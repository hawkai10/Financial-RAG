India's infrastructure output experienced a year-on-year growth of 4.3% in November, driven by robust construction activities. Notably, cement production surged by 13%, and steel production increased by 4.8%, underscoring the sector's expansion. This growth trajectory is expected to sustain the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions in the construction industry. Water Management and Conservation India's rising water scarcity has facilitated a shift towards efficient piping solutions to support water conservation and management. India faces significant water challenges, with approximately 40% of water lost during transmission due to aging infrastructure. This inefficiency has led to a heightened demand for advanced piping solutions to enhance water conservation and management efforts.\nDemand drivers for Agricultural Sector:\nIrrigation Systems Farmers are optimising their water use, which is driving the demand for these systems and PVC pipes. Approximately 47% of plastic pipes in India are utilized in the irrigation sector. With only about 50% of India's 142 million hectares of cultivated land currently under irrigation, there is substantial potential for expansion. The government's Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) aims to invest ₹500 billion over five years to enhance irrigation coverage, directly boosting the demand for PVC pipes. Hydroponic Cultivation expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control.The expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control. While specific statistics are limited, the overall growth in the plastic pipes market suggests a rising demand in this segment. Rural Electrification and Infrastructure rural areas are gaining better access to electricity and modern utilities. As a result, agricultural activity tends to increase, which, in turn, boosts the demand for PVC pipes in various applications.The government's expenditure towards water supply and sanitation has grown at an 11% CAGR to ₹416 billion over the past five years, benefiting the PVC and HDPE pipe sectors. Erratic Rainfall demand for agricultural pipes is likely to see a steady growth. The increasing unpredictability of monsoon patterns has led farmers to adopt advanced irrigation systems to\nensure consistent water supply. This shift is contributing to the sustained growth of the PVC pipes market.\nMaintained short-term credit rating -\nCRISIL / India Ratings\nCorporate Governance\nThe Board of Directors provide a strategic oversight to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders.

Despite global headwinds, the Indian equity markets and broader economic indicators offered encouraging signs of momentum heading into FY26.\nEquity Market Performance\nThe Indian equity markets experienced a moderate rebound by the end of March 2025, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices rising by approximately 6.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Although this recovery was tempered by global volatility, the low base effect from Q1 FY25 earnings is expected to support growth in FY26. However, sustained earnings expansion may hinge more on sales recovery than margin improvements. Future market returns are likely to align closely with actual earnings growth.\nManufacturing and Industrial Activity\nPMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): India's manufacturing PMI rose to an 8-month high of 58.1 in March 2025 (vs 56.3 in February), marking the 44th consecutive month above the 50-point expansion threshold. This rise was driven by strong demand, reflected in a surge in new orders. However, input prices also edged up, reaching a three-month high. Core Sector Production: The index of eight core industries contracted by 2.9% YoY in February 2025, a four-month low, following an upwardly revised growth of 5.1% in January. The contraction was largely due to an unfavorable base effect, though six of the eight sectors, including cement (up 10.5% YoY), recorded positive growth. Industrial Production (IIP): Factory output, measured by the IIP, increased by 5.0% YoY in January 2025 (vs 3.5% in December 2024). The growth was broad-based across manufacturing, mining, and electricity sectors.\nTrade and External Sector\n• Merchandise Trade:\nIn February 2025, exports declined by 10.9% YoY to $36.9 billion, while imports dropped by 16.35% to $50.96 billion. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 28% YoY to $14.05 billion.\n• Macro Dynamics and Global Trade Tensions:\nMarch saw improved domestic macro indicators—falling inflation, stable fiscal and currency conditions, and strong liquidity—even as global markets reacted to rising protectionism. The U.S. doubled tariffs on Chinese goods (20%) and increased steel and aluminum tariffs to 25%, sparking concerns over retaliatory measures and a potential escalation in trade tensions. Markets remained cautious ahead of the anticipated U.S. reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2nd.\nInflation Trends\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3.61% YoY in February 2025, down from 4.26% in January and 5.10% a year ago—below consensus expectations of 4%. This decline was aided by a favorable base effect, lower food prices, and subdued movements in fuel and clothing costs. Food inflation fell to 3.84% YoY, significantly lower than the 9.7% peak in October 2024. However, core inflation edged up slightly to 3.95% YoY (vs 3.67% in January).\nFiscal Position",

      "content": "Tax Revenues and GST Collections: Gross tax revenues for April–February FY25 grew by ~11% YoY, driven by robust direct tax collections and stable indirect taxes. However, net tax receipts grew modestly due to front-loaded state devolution. Non-tax revenues also saw a boost from record RBI and PSU dividends. March 2025 marked the 37th consecutive month of GST collections exceeding ₹1.4 trillion, with receipts of ₹1.96 trillion (+9.9% YoY). Union Budget & Fiscal Consolidation: The revised fiscal deficit target for FY25 was lowered to 4.8% of GDP (from 4.9% earlier), despite a downward revision in nominal GDP estimates. For FY26, the government targets a fiscal deficit of 4.4%, backed by strong tax collections and expenditure rationalization, while maintaining capital expenditure levels. The medium-term roadmap aims to reduce the central government's debt-to-GDP ratio to ~50% (from the current 57%) over five years. However, reliance on market borrowings remains high at 74%, above the pre-pandemic average of 66–68%.\nFixed Income Market Outlook\nSupportive Macroeconomic Environment: Improving fundamentals—including easing inflation (below 4%), a narrowing fiscal deficit, and better current account balances—create a conducive environment for accommodative monetary policy. RBI Measures and Liquidity: The Reserve Bank of India has taken proactive steps (FX swaps, Open Market Operations, and longer-tenure VRR auctions) to improve liquidity and support yields. These measures are expected to enhance monetary transmission and foster financial stability. Budget and Policy Alignment: A fiscally prudent budget focused on growth through consumption stimulus and a dovish monetary policy stance from the RBI are expected to support bond yields and interest rate stability. Global Risks Remain: Nevertheless, rising global uncertainties—particularly those stemming from the U.S. trade policy—could introduce volatility in capital flows and impact market sentiment. Market Sentiment:\nGiven RBI's aggressive stance on OMOs and supportive domestic conditions, the fixed income market is expected to remain positive, especially on the duration front. However, global cues including U.S. Treasury movements and tariff developments will remain key watchpoints.\nFinancials Forecasting\nRevenue Outlook and Market Dynamics\nThe management of the company projects a revenue growth rate of approximately 10%, which is in line with broader industry forecasts. Additionally, resin prices are expected to stabilize around ₹80 per unit, following the imposition of the anti-dumping duty ban, which is likely to support pricing stability in the near term.\nIn FY24, the company reported a 1.8% year-over-year decline in revenue, primarily driven by lower PVC prices. However, this decline was offset by a volume growth of 11%, indicating healthy underlying demand.\nSales volume projections have been based on the five-year historical average, assessed on a quarterly basis to smooth out seasonal fluctuations. A key growth driver is the non-agricultural segment, which currently accounts for 35% of total revenue. This segment is expected to increase its contribution to 50%, supported by planned capacity expansion initiatives.\nThe broader industry remains in a high-growth phase, largely due to an underserved market and increasing penetration by organized players. However, as the sector matures and competitive pressures rise, revenue growth is expected to gradually moderate over the long term.\nMargin Analysis and Profitability Outlook\nThe company's gross margins improved significantly in FY24, rising from 6.5% in FY23 to 13.8%, reflecting better pricing discipline and cost management. Similarly, EBIT per kg increased notably, from ₹5.09 in FY23 to ₹11.90 in FY24, indicating improved operational efficiency.\nHistorically, the company has maintained an average operating margin of 16.3%. However, margins saw a sharp decline in FY23 due to volatility in raw material prices, particularly in PVC.\nLooking ahead, margins are expected to stabilize around 12%, considering the company operates in a highly commoditized and competitive market that limits pricing power. Management has also indicated that margin volatility is likely to remain low, as intense competition and the standardized nature of the product keep fluctuations in check.\nBased on current projections, EBIT is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.87%, supported by volume growth and an improving product mix, particularly from the expansion of the non-agri segment.\nProperty, Plant & Equipment (PPE) - CapEx & Depreciation\nBasis for forecasting PPE – Assumptions:\nSteady Capex (₹100-200 Cr annually) for brownfield expansion. Cyclical PPE growth, with large jumps during capacity expansions. Erratic movements in CWIP, signaling delayed project execution. Gross PPE growth averaged ~5-8% CAGR over the past decade. PPE growth accelerates during expansion phases but remains stable otherwise\nMacro-economic Trends:\nGovernment Spending on Infrastructure Higher demand for PVC pipes (Jal Jeevan Mission, Smart Cities). Housing & Urbanization Growth More demand for plumbing & fittings (boosting plant capacity needs). Monsoon Cycles Affecting Agriculture Demand Finolex's core agri-piping segment faces periodic volatility. PVC Price Volatility Could impact margins, influencing Capex allocations\nMicro-economic Trends (Company specific – based on Con. Calls):\nBrownfield Expansion: ₹150 Cr per year for capacity upgrades (FY25-FY27). Greenfield Expansion (FY28-FY30): ₹250-400 Cr planned Capex, driving PPE growth. Backward Integration: PVC resin production is stable, meaning Capex will focus on pipes & fittings.\nConclusion:\nBrownfield Capex (~₹150 Cr annually, FY25-FY27) → Steady PPE growth Greenfield Expansion (~₹250-400 Cr Capex, FY28-FY30) → Accelerated PPE growth\nAssumptions for Expansion Plans:\nBrownfield:\nOngoing Capacity Enhancements:\nFinolex operates at ~68-69% capacity utilization as of FY24 Management aims to maintain headroom for growth (~10-12% volume CAGR). Brownfield expansions help de-bottleneck production and optimize efficiency without major capital risk.\nIncremental Capacity Addition Approach:\n50,000 MT increase by Q1 FY26 (25,000 MT in Q4 FY25 + 25,000 MT in Q1 FY26) Further small-scale capacity additions (~5-10% annually) planned in Ratnagiri & Masar plants Technology Upgrades: Newer machines with higher efficiency & lower scrap rates are being installed\nFinancial & Strategic Reasons for Continuous Brownfield Capex:\nBrownfield expansion costs ~30-40% less per MT vs. Greenfield projects Payback period ~3-4 years, making it financially viable Non-agri pipe demand is growing at 12-15% CAGR, requiring steady capacity expansion PVC Resin Price Cycles impact Capex timing, making phased Brownfield expansion preferable\nPlants in Ratnagiri & Masar have space for incremental expansion, avoiding land acquisition delays In-house PVC Resin production gives cost advantage, so maintaining production scale is key.

This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nWACC Calculation\nThe Cashflow \n Revenues Operating Margin EBIT EBIT(1-t) Reinvestment FCFF \n 1 5308.34 11.15% 983.90 730.43 150.00 624.82 \n 2 5850.69 11.37% 1138.23 846.24 150.00 783.07 \n 3 6463.32 11.39% 1321.18 983.16 150.00 917.48 \n 4 7156.55 11.44% 1527.83 1137.83 200.00 1024.39 \n 5 7942.32 11.49% 1766.09 1316.15 250.00 1156.63 \n 6 8734.56 11.45% 2027.70 1511.85 300.00 1325.58 \n 7 9517.97 11.50% 2295.61 1712.23 400.00 1455.64 \n 8 10275.88 11.55% 2571.22 1918.31 400.00 1694.34 \n 9 10990.69 11.54% 2851.85 2128.07 350.00 1986.57 \n 10 11644.56 11.63% 3102.92 2315.76 300.00 2247.56 \n Terminal Value 2359.943115 \n The Value \n Terminal Value 43051.07 \n PV(Terminal Value) 16151.95 \n PV(CF of 10 Years) 7202.083 \n Less: Debt -393.95 \n Add: Cash 2.15 \n Value of Equity 22962.23 \n Number of Shares 61.83139 \n Value Per share 371.3686 Stock was Trading at = ₹177\nBased on DCF Valuation, Finolex's Intrinsic Value per share is ₹371",

However taking into the fact that the company operates in a highly commodatised and competitive market the margin does not increase by a much. \n Tax Rate 25.79% 25.57% 25.57% Marginal Tax rate of the Industry\nFinolex plans on doing brownfeild as well as greenfield investment in order to increase the capacity. The capex will reach its peak around the years 2029-30 and after 2034 as\nRisk-Free Rate\nTo estimate a more accurate risk-free rate, we began with the yield on India's 10-year government bond, currently at 6.75%. From this, we subtracted the default spread of 2.39%, which reflects India's sovereign credit risk. This spread is derived from India's credit ratings—Baa3 by Moody's and BBB- by S&P both linked to government-issued, secured debt.\nIt is important to note, however, that credit ratings can be somewhat lagging indicators. They often do not capture real-time changes in risk, making them useful but imperfect tools.\nWith the risk-free rate established, the next component in estimating the cost of equity is the equity risk premium (ERP)—the additional return investors expect for choosing equities over a risk-free investment.\nCountry Moody's Rating S&P Rating Default spread \n India Baa3 BBB- 2.39%\nDefault Spread of India 2.39% \n 10 Year Treasury Bonds YTM 6.75% \n Risk Free Rate 4.36%\nEquity Risk Premium\nThe equity risk premium (ERP) represents the expected excess return investors demand for investing in equities instead of risk-free securities.\nTraditionally, ERP is computed as (Rm – Rf)—the expected market return minus the risk-free rate. However, this number varies significantly depending on several factors: the time horizon, whether a longterm bond or short-term treasury bill is used as the risk-free rate, and the averaging method (arithmetic vs. geometric).\nArithmetic Average Geometric Average \n Stocks - T. Bills Stocks - T. Bonds Stocks - T. Bills Stocks - T. Bonds \n 1928-2023 8.32% 6.80% 6.50% 5.23% \n Std Error 2.03% 2.14% \n 1974-2023 8.18% 5.95% 6.79% 4.97% \n Std Error 2.45% 2.73% \n 2014-2023 11.70% 11.17% 10.63% 10.44% \n Std Error 4.97% 3.86%\nFor example, in the U.S. market (the world's most established equity market), historical ERP from 1928 to 2023 averages 6.80%, with a standard error of 2.14%. This implies a 68% confidence interval; for 95% confidence, the standard error doubles, highlighting the significant uncertainty in ERP estimates.\nAs the analysis window narrows, the standard error increases, and the reliability of ERP diminishes.\nTo manage this uncertainty, a more practical method—especially for emerging markets like India—is to begin with the ERP of a mature market (like the U.S.) and then add a country risk premium. This adjustment provides a more robust and context-specific estimate.\nTo estimate the country risk premium, we applied the formula:\nCountry Risk Premium = Default Spread × (σEquity / σBond)\nStd Dev of 10Y Bond 0.79% \n Std Dev of Nifty 50 1.04% \n Default spread of India 2.39% \n Risk Premium of India 3.135% \n Mature Market Premium 4.12% \n Equity Risk Premium 7.25%\nWhere the volatility of the equity market is scaled relative to long-term government bonds.\nWith both the risk-free rate and ERP defined, the final component of the cost of equity is beta, which captures the firm's sensitivity to market movements.\nBeta Estimation\nFor Finolex, we employed an industry beta approach rather than using firm-specific betas, which tend to be volatile and unreliable.\nOur method involved:\nCalculating firm-level betas using 2-year and 5-year weekly return data, assigning a two-thirds weight to the 2-year beta and one-third to the 5-year beta to balance recency and long-term perspective.\nIndustry Name Number of firms Beta D/E Ratio Effective Tax rate Unlevered beta \n PVC Resins Chemical (Basic) 145 0.82x 9.53% 19.97% 0.760x \n PVC Pipes & Fittings Building Materials 57 0.84x 5.48% 18.35% 0.802x \n Revenue Peer EV / Sales Weights Weight Beta \n 132.28 2.73 361.12 0.03 0.02 \n 4185.15 3.17 13266.93 0.97 0.78 \n 4317.43 5.90 13628.05 0.8013\nAveraging these across the industry to arrive at a stable estimate.\nWe then unlevered the industry beta using the sector's average debt-to-equity ratio.\nSince Finolex operates across multiple industries, we computed a weighted average unlevered beta, using peer EV/Sales multiples to proportionally represent exposure to each business segment. The final re-\nlevered beta was adjusted using Finolex's actual capital structure and the prevailing marginal tax rate in India.\nUnlevered Beta 0.801x \n Debt to Equity Ratio 0.0711 \n Tax Rate 25.57% \n Leavered Beta 0.844x \n Cost of Equity 10.48%\nThis led us to a cost of equity of 10.48%.\nCost of Debt\nTo accurately estimate Finolex's cost of debt, we incorporated both country-level and company-specific risks.\nThe methodology was as follows:\nWe began with the risk-free rate, then added:\nThe country default spread, previously used in estimating the risk-free rate.\nA company-specific default spread, derived from Finolex's long-term credit rating and its interest coverage ratio.\nThese three elements combined yield a pre-tax cost of debt of 7.27%.\nCost of Debt \n Type of Company Smaller and riskier firms \n Long Term Debt Rating Aa2/AA \n Interest Coverage Ratio 16.91 \n Default Spread\nbased on \n Debt Rating 0.60% \n ICR 0.45% \n Default Spread of Compa 0.53% \n Default Spread of the Co 2.39% \n Risk Free Rate 4.36% \n Cost of Debt 7.28% \n Post Tax Cost of Debt 5.42%",

The valuation was based on projected revenue growth, operating margins, reinvestment requirements, and a calculated terminal value beyond the forecast period.\nCash Flow Projections\nThe revenue is projected to grow consistently over a 10-year period, from ₹5,308.34 crore in Year 1 to ₹11,644.56 crore in Year 10. Operating margins are expected to remain stable in the range of 11.4%– 11.8%, indicating a steady level of profitability.\nUsing these projections, the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) were calculated for each year. After adjusting for taxes, the EBIT(1–t) was derived. The reinvestment required to sustain the business's growth was then deducted to estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF). The FCFF values increase from ₹347.10 crore in Year 1 to ₹896.10 crore in Year 10, reflecting both operational efficiency and strategic reinvestment.\nTerminal Value and Present Value Calculations\nTo account for the value beyond the 10-year forecast period, a terminal value of ₹17,164.44 crore was assumed. This terminal value, when discounted to present value terms, is ₹6,439.77 crore. The present value of the 10 years of forecasted cash flows amounts to ₹3,229.82 crore. The total present value of future cash flows (enterprise value) is therefore estimated at ₹9,669.59 crore.\nEquity Value Estimation\nFrom the enterprise value, net debt of ₹393.95 crore was deducted, and ₹2.15 crore in cash was added, resulting in a total equity value of ₹11,616 crore.\nWith a total of 61.83 crore shares outstanding, the intrinsic value per share is calculated to be ₹187.87.\nRelative Valuation\nFor the relative Valuation portion, we screened firms with the following criteria:\nSame industry as Finolex Industries.

With a current EV of ₹9,669.59 Cr and FY24 revenue of ₹4,464.62 Cr, the company trades at an EV/Sales multiple of ~2.17, which is nearly 31% lower than the industry average of 3.15. At first glance, this might suggest undervaluation. But applying deeper logic to this surface-level discount tells a more complicated story.\nAssume revenue grows at a projected CAGR of 9–10% till 2029, and EBIT margins hold around 11%—a reasonable but not spectacular figure. These inputs point to a business that is fundamentally stable but not bursting with growth, disruption, or pricing power.\nWhat Is the Market Really Pricing In?\nIf we attempt to back-solve from Finolex's current market price of ₹177, we find implied valuations inconsistent with its fundamentals. For example, the EV/EBITDA multiple for positive EBITDA firms in the industry is 26.17, while Finolex would barely command that unless its margins balloon or its growth exceeds expectations dramatically. The same logic applies to EV/Sales and Price/Sales.\nEven more startling: the implied price using the industry P/E multiple (34.78) results in a valuation of ₹256.09, nearly 45% above current levels—but only if the company is treated as an industry average performer, which seems optimistic for a commodity-heavy business facing cyclical pressures.\nSo Why the Optimism?",

But these are weak foundations for a sustained rerating, especially with terminal growth assumptions capped at 5% in line with GDP and a WACC of 10.3% acting as a valuation ceiling.\nIntrinsic Valuation (FCFF Method)\nUsing the Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) method, the intrinsic value of the company's stock has been calculated at ₹371 per share . This valuation is based on projected free cash flows, discounted at the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The result indicates that the stock is currently significantly undervalued relative to its fair value based on fundamentals.\nRelative Valuation\nIn addition to the DCF-based intrinsic valuation, a relative valuation was conducted using key market multiples such as EV/EBITDA, P/E, and EV/Sales, benchmarked against comparable peers in the industry. This approach captures the market's pricing of similar companies and provides an external reference point for valuation.\nFinal Valuation and Recommendation\nTo ensure a balanced view, an equally weighted average of the intrinsic value from the FCFF method and the relative valuation was taken. This results in a final estimated intrinsic value of ₹203.28 per share .\nWith this more conservative blended approach, the stock appears overvalued relative to its current market price .\nRecommendation\nGiven the overvaluation indicated by both intrinsic and relative methods, we issue a sell recommendation on the stock.",

Demand drivers for Agricultural Sector:\nIrrigation Systems Farmers are optimising their water use, which is driving the demand for these systems and PVC pipes. Approximately 47% of plastic pipes in India are utilized in the irrigation sector. With only about 50% of India's 142 million hectares of cultivated land currently under irrigation, there is substantial potential for expansion. The government's Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) aims to invest ₹500 billion over five years to enhance irrigation coverage, directly boosting the demand for PVC pipes. Hydroponic Cultivation expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control.The expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control. While specific statistics are limited, the overall growth in the plastic pipes market suggests a rising demand in this segment.

Economic Overview of India (As of March 2025)\nIndia's macroeconomic landscape showed a mixed trend during the first quarter of 2025, shaped by domestic resilience and global uncertainties. Despite global headwinds, the Indian equity markets and broader economic indicators offered encouraging signs of momentum heading into FY26.\nEquity Market Performance\nThe Indian equity markets experienced a moderate rebound by the end of March 2025, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices rising by approximately 6.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Although this recovery was tempered by global volatility, the low base effect from Q1 FY25 earnings is expected to support growth in FY26. However, sustained earnings expansion may hinge more on sales recovery than margin improvements.

However, sustained earnings expansion may hinge more on sales recovery than margin improvements. Future market returns are likely to align closely with actual earnings growth. Manufacturing and Industrial Activity\nPMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): India's manufacturing PMI rose to an 8-month high of 58.1 in March 2025 (vs 56.3 in February), marking the 44th consecutive month above the 50-point expansion threshold. This rise was driven by strong demand, reflected in a surge in new orders. However, input prices also edged up, reaching a three-month high. Core Sector Production: The index of eight core industries contracted by 2.9% YoY in February 2025, a four-month low, following an upwardly revised growth of 5.1% in January. The contraction was largely due to an unfavorable base effect, though six of the eight sectors, including cement (up 10.5% YoY), recorded positive growth.

As a result, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 28% YoY to $14.05 billion.\n• Macro Dynamics and Global Trade Tensions:\nMarch saw improved domestic macro indicators—falling inflation, stable fiscal and currency conditions, and strong liquidity—even as global markets reacted to rising protectionism. The U.S. doubled tariffs on Chinese goods (20%) and increased steel and aluminum tariffs to 25%, sparking concerns over retaliatory measures and a potential escalation in trade tensions.

This decline was aided by a favorable base effect, lower food prices, and subdued movements in fuel and clothing costs. Food inflation fell to 3.84% YoY, significantly lower than the 9.7% peak in October 2024. However, core inflation edged up slightly to 3.95% YoY (vs 3.67% in January).\nFiscal Position",

However, this decline was offset by a volume growth of 11%, indicating healthy underlying demand.\nSales volume projections have been based on the five-year historical average, assessed on a quarterly basis to smooth out seasonal fluctuations. A key growth driver is the non-agricultural segment, which currently accounts for 35% of total revenue. This segment is expected to increase its contribution to 50%, supported by planned capacity expansion initiatives.\nThe broader industry remains in a high-growth phase, largely due to an underserved market and increasing penetration by organized players. However, as the sector matures and competitive pressures rise, revenue growth is expected to gradually moderate over the long term.\nMargin Analysis and Profitability Outlook\nThe company's gross margins improved significantly in FY24, rising from 6.5% in FY23 to 13.8%, reflecting better pricing discipline and cost management.

Terminal Value and Present Value Calculations\nTo account for the value beyond the 10-year forecast period, a terminal value of ₹17,164.44 crore was assumed. This terminal value, when discounted to present value terms, is ₹6,439.77 crore. The present value of the 10 years of forecasted cash flows amounts to ₹3,229.82 crore.
