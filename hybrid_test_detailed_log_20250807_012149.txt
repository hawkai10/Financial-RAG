  Corrected Query: Analyze the impact of using the Nifty 500 index for research.

PROCESSING DETAILS:

  Processing Time: 6.99 seconds
  Success: True

FULL ANSWER (AS DISPLAYED IN UI):
----------------------------------------
<p>Using the Nifty 500 index as the research base allowed the study to evaluate a deletions-based investment strategy in the Indian equity market.  The study constructed portfolios from stocks removed from the Nifty 500 over a five-year period.  A rigorous financial quality screen was applied to identify potential recovery candidates.  The results, while showing the strategy underperforming the Nifty 500 in raw returns, demonstrated lower volatility, smaller drawdowns, and a higher Sharpe ratio compared to the benchmark.  Importantly, the strategy generated positive Jensen's alpha, suggesting it delivered value beyond what would be expected from just market exposure.  This analysis suggests the Nifty 500 provides a suitable, robust base for testing this particular investment strategy.</p>
