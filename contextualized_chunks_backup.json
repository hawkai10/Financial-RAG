A  deletions-based  strategy  focuses  on stocks  removed  from  major  indices  under  the premise that such deletions may create temporary mispricing. According to the theory of mean reversion, securities that experience forced selling pressure due to index reconstitution may subsequently recover once temporary distortions subside, provided their underlying fundamentals remain intact. This phenomenon has been observed in several developed markets and offers an intriguing basis for systematic investment strategies. The motivation for applying a deletionsbased  approach  to  the  Indian  market  lies  in  its unique  market  structure,  growing  institutional participation,  and  the  increasing  importance  of passive investment vehicles tied to major indices like the Nifty 500. Given these dynamics, studying how index deletions behave in India can offer valuable insights into market efficiency, price discovery mechanisms, and the potential for meanreversion-based strategies in an emerging market context. The primary objective of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate a systematic deletions-based  investment  strategy  using  the Nifty 500 universe, incorporating a quality screening  framework  to  mitigate  financial  distress risks. By analyzing a comprehensive historical dataset from 2007 to 2024, this study aims to assess whether such a strategy can be effectively applied in the Indian equity market and to identify the challenges and opportunities associated with its implementation. 3.

    "raw_chunk_text": "CONCLUSION\nThis study set out to evaluate the performance  and  viability  of  a  systematic  deletionsbased  investment  strategy  in  the  Indian  equity market, using the Nifty 500 as the base universe. By constructing portfolios composed of stocks removed from the index over a trailing five-year period  and  applying  a  structured  financial  quality screen, the strategy aimed to identify overlooked recovery  candidates  while  avoiding  fundamentally weak companies. Over  the  11-year  backtest  period  from 2015  to  2025,  the  strategy  generated  a Compounded  Annual  Growth  Rate  (CAGR)  of 12.48% , compared to 15.22% for the Nifty 500. While the strategy underperformed the benchmark in raw returns, it exhibited lower volatility (1.21% vs. 1.70%) , smaller drawdowns , and a higher Sharpe ratio (6.72 vs. 6.38) . Furthermore,  the  strategy  produced positive  Jensen's alpha (1.60%) , indicating that it delivered value beyond what would be expected based on market exposure alone. These  results  suggest  that  a  deletionsbased approach, when combined with robust financial screening, can offer meaningful risk-adjusted returns and may serve as a complementary satellite strategy within a diversified portfolio.

    "chunk_text": "CONCLUSION\nThis study set out to evaluate the performance  and  viability  of  a  systematic  deletionsbased  investment  strategy  in  the  Indian  equity market, using the Nifty 500 as the base universe. By constructing portfolios composed of stocks removed from the index over a trailing five-year period  and  applying  a  structured  financial  quality screen, the strategy aimed to identify overlooked recovery  candidates  while  avoiding  fundamentally weak companies. Over  the  11-year  backtest  period  from 2015  to  2025,  the  strategy  generated  a Compounded  Annual  Growth  Rate  (CAGR)  of 12.48% , compared to 15.22% for the Nifty 500. While the strategy underperformed the benchmark in raw returns, it exhibited lower volatility (1.21% vs. 1.70%) , smaller drawdowns , and a higher Sharpe ratio (6.72 vs. 6.38) . Furthermore,  the  strategy  produced positive  Jensen's alpha (1.60%) , indicating that it delivered value beyond what would be expected based on market exposure alone. These  results  suggest  that  a  deletionsbased approach, when combined with robust financial screening, can offer meaningful risk-adjusted returns and may serve as a complementary satellite strategy within a diversified portfolio.

However, implementation in a live fund would require careful attention to liquidity, trading costs, and regulatory compliance. Real-world application would also necessitate enhanced risk controls, including sector neutrality and transaction cost overlays, to ensure that the fund remains efficient and scalable at institutional asset levels. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nSeveral  limitations  must  be  acknowledged. First, the study assumes zero transaction costs and perfect liquidity, which may overstate net returns in practice. Second, survivorship bias could be present, as some delisted or permanently halted stocks may have been excluded from the dataset due to lack of accessible financial data. Third, while the scoring framework is robust, it uses equal weighting across metrics, which may not be optimal across all market cycles or industries. Future research could explore the addition  of momentum  or  sector  filters ,  dynamic weightings, or machine learning techniques to enhance  score  calibration. Incorporating  realworld frictions such as slippage, bid-ask spreads, and  execution  delays  would  also  offer  a  more grounded view of live implementability. Furthermore,  analyzing  the  strategy's  behavior  across different sub-indices (e.g., mid-cap or small-cap deletions) may reveal additional pockets of alpha. In conclusion, while the deletions-based strategy did not outperform the benchmark in absolute terms, it demonstrated consistency, lower risk, and strong recovery potential-making it a viable  candidate  for  further  development  as  a smart beta product in India's growing passive investment ecosystem.
