A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company. Return on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nWACC Calculation\nThe Cashflow\nRevenues Operating Margin EBIT EBIT(1-t) Reinvestment FCFF\n1 5308.34 11.15% 983.90 730.43 150.00 624.82\nFinancial analysis of Finolex, focusing on debt levels, return on capital employed (ROCE), and cash flow."

Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days.
