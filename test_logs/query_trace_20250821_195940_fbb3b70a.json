The valuation was based on projected revenue growth, operating margins, reinvestment requirements, and a calculated terminal value beyond the forecast period.\nCash Flow Projections\nThe revenue is projected to grow consistently over a 10-year period, from ₹5,308.34 crore in Year 1 to ₹11,644.56 crore in Year 10. Operating margins are expected to remain stable in the range of 11.4%– 11.8%, indicating a steady level of profitability.\nUsing these projections, the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) were calculated for each year. After adjusting for taxes, the EBIT(1–t) was derived. The reinvestment required to sustain the business's growth was then deducted to estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF). The FCFF values increase from ₹347.10 crore in Year 1 to ₹896.10 crore in Year 10, reflecting both operational efficiency and strategic reinvestment.\nTerminal Value and Present Value Calculations\nTo account for the value beyond the 10-year forecast period, a terminal value of ₹17,164.44 crore was assumed. This terminal value, when discounted to present value terms, is ₹6,439.77 crore. The present value of the 10 years of forecasted cash flows amounts to ₹3,229.82 crore.

With a current EV of ₹9,669.59 Cr and FY24 revenue of ₹4,464.62 Cr, the company trades at an EV/Sales multiple of ~2.17, which is nearly 31% lower than the industry average of 3.15. At first glance, this might suggest undervaluation. But applying deeper logic to this surface-level discount tells a more complicated story.\nAssume revenue grows at a projected CAGR of 9–10% till 2029, and EBIT margins hold around 11%—a reasonable but not spectacular figure. These inputs point to a business that is fundamentally stable but not bursting with growth, disruption, or pricing power.\nWhat Is the Market Really Pricing In?\nIf we attempt to back-solve from Finolex's current market price of ₹177, we find implied valuations inconsistent with its fundamentals. For example, the EV/EBITDA multiple for positive EBITDA firms in the industry is 26.17, while Finolex would barely command that unless its margins balloon or its growth exceeds expectations dramatically. The same logic applies to EV/Sales and Price/Sales.\nEven more startling: the implied price using the industry P/E multiple (34.78) results in a valuation of ₹256.09, nearly 45% above current levels—but only if the company is treated as an industry average performer, which seems optimistic for a commodity-heavy business facing cyclical pressures.\nSo Why the Optimism?\n\n[Source 3: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nBrownfield capacity (50,000 MT) being sufficient till FY27. Uncertainty in market demand, especially for large-scale capacity investments. Preference for lower-risk Brownfield expansion in the short term.\nHowever, Greenfield expansion remains inevitable, as:\nNew regional markets (East & South India) require a new facility.\nCurrent plant locations (Ratnagiri, Masar) have limited long-term scalability.

FY27: Final investment decision. FY28-FY29: Construction & phased capacity rollout. FY30: Full commercial production.\nWhy does CWIP grow first?\nGreenfield projects take 18-24 months to build, so assets remain in CWIP before being capitalized into PPE.\nFY30 sees full impact of PPE additions as Greenfield reaches operational status.\nConsolidated PPE Forecast Based on CAGR\nHistorical PPE Growth Rate:\nFY20-FY24 CAGR: ~4.5%-6.0% (mostly brownfield expansion) FY25-FY30 CAGR (Adjusted for Greenfield): Gross PPE: ~8.9% CAGR & Net PPE: ~7.8% CAGR (due to increasing depreciation).\nCapex Plan Integrated:\n₹150 Cr Brownfield Capex (FY25-FY27), ₹250-400 Cr Greenfield Capex (FY28-FY30).

This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies.
