Despite global headwinds, the Indian equity markets and broader economic indicators offered encouraging signs of momentum heading into FY26.\nEquity Market Performance\nThe Indian equity markets experienced a moderate rebound by the end of March 2025, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices rising by approximately 6.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Although this recovery was tempered by global volatility, the low base effect from Q1 FY25 earnings is expected to support growth in FY26. However, sustained earnings expansion may hinge more on sales recovery than margin improvements. Future market returns are likely to align closely with actual earnings growth.\nManufacturing and Industrial Activity\nPMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): India's manufacturing PMI rose to an 8-month high of 58.1 in March 2025 (vs 56.3 in February), marking the 44th consecutive month above the 50-point expansion threshold. This rise was driven by strong demand, reflected in a surge in new orders. However, input prices also edged up, reaching a three-month high. Core Sector Production: The index of eight core industries contracted by 2.9% YoY in February 2025, a four-month low, following an upwardly revised growth of 5.1% in January. The contraction was largely due to an unfavorable base effect, though six of the eight sectors, including cement (up 10.5% YoY), recorded positive growth. Industrial Production (IIP): Factory output, measured by the IIP, increased by 5.0% YoY in January 2025 (vs 3.5% in December 2024). The growth was broad-based across manufacturing, mining, and electricity sectors.\nTrade and External Sector\n• Merchandise Trade:\nIn February 2025, exports declined by 10.9% YoY to $36.9 billion, while imports dropped by 16.35% to $50.96 billion. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 28% YoY to $14.05 billion.\n• Macro Dynamics and Global Trade Tensions:\nMarch saw improved domestic macro indicators—falling inflation, stable fiscal and currency conditions, and strong liquidity—even as global markets reacted to rising protectionism. The U.S. doubled tariffs on Chinese goods (20%) and increased steel and aluminum tariffs to 25%, sparking concerns over retaliatory measures and a potential escalation in trade tensions. Markets remained cautious ahead of the anticipated U.S. reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2nd.\nInflation Trends\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3.61% YoY in February 2025, down from 4.26% in January and 5.10% a year ago—below consensus expectations of 4%. This decline was aided by a favorable base effect, lower food prices, and subdued movements in fuel and clothing costs. Food inflation fell to 3.84% YoY, significantly lower than the 9.7% peak in October 2024. However, core inflation edged up slightly to 3.95% YoY (vs 3.67% in January).\nFiscal Position\n\n[Source 2: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nFINANCIAL MODELING\nSubmitted To: Mr Hardik Pathak Topic: Fundamental Analysis of Finolex Industries Ltd.\nBuddy Group 9 B005 - Anirudh Agarwal B013 - Bhushit Sardana B015 - Harsh Lohia B024 - Nandini Bansal B032 - Rehan Qureshi B050 - Arvind Kedia\nCompany Introduction\nFinolex Industries Limited is a leading producer of Polyvinyl Chloride,pipes & fittings and PVC resin in India. It is the largest and only backward-integrated pipes & fittings company in India.\nThe Finolex Group of companies was founded in 1958 by Pralhad P. Chhabria and Kishan P. Chhabria, who initially started as a copper cable manufacturer and later diversified into PVC insulated electrical cables for the automobile industry.\nThe Company's diverse product range caters to various sectors., including plumbing, sanitation, and agriculture providing solutions for a wide range of customer needs. Company bifurcates these sectors as Agricultural and Non-Agricultural Sector. The company has a stable long term credit rating of AA+.\nSome of its Demand Drivers are as follows:\nDemand drivers for Non-Agricultural Sector:\nConstruction Market Expansion As urbanisation continues, the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions is expected to remain strong, supporting the growth of the PVC pipe & fittings industry. India's infrastructure output experienced a year-on-year growth of 4.3% in November, driven by robust construction activities. Notably, cement production surged by 13%, and steel production increased by 4.8%, underscoring the sector's expansion. This growth trajectory is expected to sustain the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions in the construction industry. Water Management and Conservation India's rising water scarcity has facilitated a shift towards efficient piping solutions to support water conservation and management. India faces significant water challenges, with approximately 40% of water lost during transmission due to aging infrastructure. This inefficiency has led to a heightened demand for advanced piping solutions to enhance water conservation and management efforts.\nDemand drivers for Agricultural Sector:\nIrrigation Systems Farmers are optimising their water use, which is driving the demand for these systems and PVC pipes. Approximately 47% of plastic pipes in India are utilized in the irrigation sector. With only about 50% of India's 142 million hectares of cultivated land currently under irrigation, there is substantial potential for expansion. The government's Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) aims to invest ₹500 billion over five years to enhance irrigation coverage, directly boosting the demand for PVC pipes. Hydroponic Cultivation expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control.The expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control. While specific statistics are limited, the overall growth in the plastic pipes market suggests a rising demand in this segment. Rural Electrification and Infrastructure rural areas are gaining better access to electricity and modern utilities. As a result, agricultural activity tends to increase, which, in turn, boosts the demand for PVC pipes in various applications.The government's expenditure towards water supply and sanitation has grown at an 11% CAGR to ₹416 billion over the past five years, benefiting the PVC and HDPE pipe sectors. Erratic Rainfall demand for agricultural pipes is likely to see a steady growth. The increasing unpredictability of monsoon patterns has led farmers to adopt advanced irrigation systems to\nensure consistent water supply. This shift is contributing to the sustained growth of the PVC pipes market.\nMaintained short-term credit rating -\nCRISIL / India Ratings\nCorporate Governance\nThe Board of Directors provide a strategic oversight to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders.
