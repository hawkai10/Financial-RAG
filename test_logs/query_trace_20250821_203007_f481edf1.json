This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies.

We create annual portfolios of Nifty 500 equities taken out over the past five years using a proprietary approach. To eliminate high-risk enterprises, a rigorous quality screening system uses six financial metrics: debt coverage, equity issuance, debt issuance, leverage change, and payout ratios. The worst 20% of stocks are eliminated from the investable universe each year using a percentile-based composite grading algorithm. Rebalanced annually on the last trading day of May, the portfolios typically contain 100 equallyweighted equities. T\nWe adjust for survivorship bias, transaction costs, and liquidity constraints in our 14-year empirical research from 2010 to 2024 with over 1,000 stock occurrences.\nWhen vetted for financial quality, indexexcluded stocks offer considerable mean-reversion chances in Indian equities. The study shows that alternative indexing strategies outside factor models can impact ETF product design, institutional asset allocation, and smart beta developments in emerging markets. To improve the technique, future study might use dynamic weighting, sector-neutral positioning, and multi-factor overlays.\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the past two decades, the rise of smart beta and alternative index construction strategies has reshaped the investment management landscape. Moving beyond traditional market capitalization-weighted approaches, smart beta strategies seek to systematically capture specific factors such as value, momentum, quality, or volatility in an attempt to achieve superior riskadjusted returns. Among these alternative strategies, those built around corporate events — including index additions and deletions — have received increasing academic and practitioner attention.\nA deletions-based strategy focuses on stocks removed from major indices under the premise that such deletions may create temporary mispricing. According to the theory of mean reversion, securities that experience forced selling pressure due to index reconstitution may subsequently recover once temporary distortions subside, provided their underlying fundamentals remain intact. This phenomenon has been observed in several developed markets and offers an intriguing basis for systematic investment strategies.\nThe motivation for applying a deletionsbased approach to the Indian market lies in its unique market structure, growing institutional participation, and the increasing importance of passive investment vehicles tied to major indices like the Nifty 500. Given these dynamics, studying how index deletions behave in India can offer valuable insights into market efficiency, price discovery mechanisms, and the potential for meanreversion-based strategies in an emerging market context.\nThe primary objective of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate a systematic deletions-based investment strategy using the Nifty 500 universe, incorporating a quality screening framework to mitigate financial distress risks. By analyzing a comprehensive historical dataset from 2007 to 2024, this study aims to assess whether such a strategy can be effectively applied in the Indian equity market and to identify the challenges and opportunities associated with its implementation.\n3. DATA & METHODOLOGY 3.1 DATA SOURCES\nThe study relies on a comprehensive dataset comprising stock price histories, fundamental financial ratios, and index constituent changes over an extended period from 2007 to 2024.\nHistorical daily adjusted closing prices for Indian equities were collected using the yfinance Python library, which offers a reliable interface for accessing publicly available market data. The dataset ensures coverage of all companies that were, at any point, part of the Nifty 500 universe or subsequently removed from it during the sample period.\nFinancial data was extracted by programmatically scraping Screener.in, a widely used platform for accessing fundamental data on Indian listed companies. Screener.in aggregates company financials from official filings and standardizes them across time periods, making it a suitable source for structured data extraction.\nAfter retrieval, key financial ratios required for the strategy were computed manually using Python to maintain control over the formula definitions and ensure uniformity across all years and companies. This step also allowed for customization of ratio components in accordance with the specific requirements of the strategy. Key financial fields used in the calculations included income, total debt, equity issuance, retained earnings, gross profits, dividends, buybacks, and long-term assets and liabilities.\nTo track index constituent changes, data regarding annual additions and deletions from the Nifty 500 was sourced from official announcements made by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and cross-referenced against third-party public repositories where necessary. All deletions between 2009 and 2024 were tracked to build an accurate and continuous deletion history, enabling the construction of a five-year trailing eligibility pool at every rebalance point.\nIt is acknowledged that despite efforts to ensure completeness, survivorship bias may exist due to the unavailability of complete historical financial data for companies whose trading was permanently halted or whose financial disclosures ceased to be available after delisting.\n3.2 PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION\nThe portfolio construction methodology employed in this study was designed to systematically identify, screen, and invest in stocks removed from the Nifty 500 index, with the aim of capturing potential mean-reversion opportunities while minimizing exposure to financially distressed firms. The construction process was executed through a series of well-defined, rule-based steps as outlined below:\nFIVE-YEAR DELETION LOOKBACK\nAt each annual rebalance date, a fiveyear lookback window was applied to identify all companies that had been removed from the Nifty 500 index during the preceding five calendar years. This step ensured that the investment universe was not limited to stocks recently deleted but included companies that may have experienced prolonged underperformance yet retained recovery potential. For instance, at the March 2020 rebalance, the eligible deletion pool included all companies dropped from the index between 2015 and 2019.\nThis five-year horizon was selected to strike a balance between capturing a wide enough sample of potential candidates and avoiding stocks that may have become fundamentally unviable due to extended declines.\nQUALITY SCREENING USING FINAN- CIAL RATIOS\nTo evaluate the financial soundness of the deletion candidates, a quality screen was applied using six carefully chosen financial ratios:\nDebt Coverage Ratio – measures the company's ability to meet debt obligations using operating income.\nEquity Issuance Growth – assesses the dilution risk by evaluating the annual increase in outstanding shares.\nDebt Issuance Growth – identifies increased reliance on debt financing.\nChange in Leverage – captures shifts in longterm debt relative to total assets.\nTotal Payout Ratio – computed as five-year cumulative retained earnings to gross profits.\nNet Payout Ratio – five-year average of dividends and buybacks relative to total assets.\nThese ratios collectively represent multiple dimensions of a firm's financial position,\nincluding solvency, capital structure, shareholder orientation, and earnings quality.\nEach ratio was normalized using percentile ranking within the eligible universe for that year. This method assigned each company a score between 0 and 100 on each metric, reducing the influence of extreme outliers and enabling fair comparison across firms and years.\n\nAnswer concisely and cite facts from the context.",
