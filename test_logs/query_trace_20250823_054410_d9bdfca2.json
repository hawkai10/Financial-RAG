Additionally, resin prices are expected to stabilize around ₹80 per unit, following the imposition of the anti-dumping duty ban, which is likely to support pricing stability in the near term. In FY24, the company reported a 1.8% year-over-year decline in revenue, primarily driven by lower PVC prices. However, this decline was offset by a volume growth of 11%, indicating healthy underlying demand.\nSales volume projections have been based on the five-year historical average, assessed on a quarterly basis to smooth out seasonal fluctuations. A key growth driver is the non-agricultural segment, which currently accounts for 35% of total revenue. This segment is expected to increase its contribution to 50%, supported by planned capacity expansion initiatives.\nThe broader industry remains in a high-growth phase, largely due to an underserved market and increasing penetration by organized players. However, as the sector matures and competitive pressures rise, revenue growth is expected to gradually moderate over the long term.\nMargin Analysis and Profitability Outlook\nThe company's gross margins improved significantly in FY24, rising from 6.5% in FY23 to 13.8%, reflecting better pricing discipline and cost management. Similarly, EBIT per kg increased notably, from ₹5.09 in FY23 to ₹11.90 in FY24, indicating improved operational efficiency.\nCompany revenue growth projected at 10%, in line with industry forecasts, supported by stable resin prices and strong non-agricultural segment growth.

This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies.

Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr.

This step was intended to systematically eliminate firms showing the most severe signs of financial deterioration, such as excessive leverage, poor earnings retention, or aggressive equity issuance.\nBy excluding the lowest quintile, the strategy aimed to avoid allocating capital to companies with the highest risk of continued decline or default.\nEQUAL-WEIGHT PORTFOLIO SELECTION\nFrom the remaining pool of screened companies, the top 100 stocks were selected based on their quality score ranking. Each of these stocks was assigned an equal weight, regardless of market capitalization, sector, or historical performance. This choice reflects a belief in diversifying idiosyncratic risk while ensuring that no single position disproportionately drives overall performance.\nThe equal-weighting approach also avoids unintended tilts toward large-cap or high-\nvolatility stocks and ensures that all constituents contribute equally to returns and risk.\nANNUAL REBALANCING IN MARCH\nThe portfolio was rebalanced annually on March 31st . On this date, the full process of deletion screening, quality scoring, and portfolio reconstruction was repeated using the most recent available data. All positions were liquidated and reallocated in accordance with the newly selected basket of equally weighted stocks.\nThis rebalancing frequency was chosen to limit trading costs while allowing sufficient time for mean-reversion effects to materialize and for updated financial data to be reflected in the screening process.\n3.3 SCORING MECHANISM\nThe scoring framework for evaluating the financial health of companies in the deletions pool was designed to convert a diverse set of raw financial metrics into a standardized, comparable form. This was necessary to enable consistent ranking and filtering of firms across multiple dimensions of financial quality.\nNORMALIZATION USING PERCENTILE RANKING\nGiven the varying scales, units, and distributions of the six financial ratios used in the quality screen, raw values were not directly comparable. To address this, percentile ranking was employed as the primary normalization method. Under this approach, each firm was assigned a score from 0 to 100 for each ratio based on its relative position in the annual distribution of the eligible pool.\nPercentile ranking offers several key advantages:\n• Robustness to Outliers : Extreme values do not disproportionately influence the scale, unlike z-scores.\nComparability Across Metrics : All six metrics are transformed onto the same 0– 100 scale, facilitating equal treatment during aggregation. Interpretability : Percentile scores are easy to understand and interpret in terms of relative ranking.\nZ-score normalization was considered as an alternative but was ultimately not used due to its sensitivity to outliers and its assumption of normally distributed data, which did not hold for several financial metrics with skewed distributions.\nCALCULATION OF COMPOSITE QUALITY SCORE\nFor each company, a composite quality score was computed as the simple arithmetic av erage of its six normalized percentile scores. Each financial metric was assigned an equal weight of 16.67% , reflecting the assumption that no single metric should dominate the overall quality assessment.\nThis composite score provided a unified measure of a firm's financial strength, capturing its standing across multiple dimensions including debt management, capital structure, payout discipline, and dilution risk.\nThe equal-weighted scoring methodology also helped maintain transparency and avoided overfitting or data mining, which could occur if subjective or optimized weights were used.\nTHRESHOLD-BASED FILTERING\nAfter calculating the composite scores, a threshold filter was applied: companies falling in the bottom 20% of the score distribution were excluded from portfolio eligibility. This exclusion was applied annually, and only companies in the top 80% by quality score were retained for portfolio inclusion.\nAll remaining stocks that passed this quality screen were included in the final portfolio on an equal-weighted basis, regardless of how many companies met the criteria in a given year. This dynamic sizing allowed the portfolio to adapt to variations in market conditions and the financial health of the deletions pool each year.\n4.1 PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE\nThe deletions-based investment strategy was tested over an 11-year period from 2015 to 2025, during which it was rebalanced annually based on a rules-driven framework. This period includes a diverse mix of market conditions ranging from the post-2013 recovery phase, the 2020 COVID-19 crash, and the post-pandemic bull rally—offering a robust testing ground for the strategy's behavior across economic cycles.\nANNUAL RETURNS AND VOLATILITY\nTable below summarizes the annual performance of the deletions-based strategy and compares it to the Nifty 500 benchmark:\nThe data reveals several key insights. First, the strategy exhibits significant perfor mance dispersion —with annual returns ranging from a high of +121.72% in 2021 to a low of – 48.37% in 2020. This reflects the inherent cyclical nature of a strategy focused on companies previously removed from the index, many of which are in stages of operational turnaround or market revaluation.\nDespite these large swings, the strategy's Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the entire period was 12.48% , which while lower than the 15.22% CAGR of the Nifty 500 ,\nstill represents a solid absolute performance for a strategy centered around out-of-favor names.\nRISK AND RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN\nA standout characteristic of the deletions strategy is its relatively low volatility , with an annualized standard deviation of 1.21% , compared to 1.70% for the Nifty 500. This suggests that the strategy, although composed of companies removed from the index (often perceived as higher-risk), delivered more stable returns due to the rigorous financial quality screening applied.\nIn terms of risk-adjusted performance , the strategy generated a Sharpe Ratio of 6.72 , compared to 6.38 for the Nifty 500 . The Sharpe ratio was calculated using a risk-free rate of 4.35% , derived by adjusting India's 10-year government bond yield (6.75%) for the country's credit spread (2.39%). This adjustment ensures a more realistic estimate of true risk-free return in the Indian context.\nNotably, the maximum drawdown —the worst peak-to-trough decline in NAV—was 11.15% for the deletions strategy versus 11.65% for the benchmark. This indicates that the strategy was less susceptible to deep losses , even though\nits constituents were formerly excluded from a major index. This resilience is likely attributable to the use of percentile-based quality scoring, which systematically filters out financially weak firms.\nBEHAVIORAL PATTERNS AND CYCLI- CAL RESPONSE\n\n[Source 3: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nIndian PVC pipes & fittings market valued at $5.42 billion in 2023. It is expected to grow at 5.81% CAGR, reaching $8.05 billion by 2030. There is strong growth across agriculture, real estate, sanitation, and infrastructure sectors.

Raw Material Price Fluctuations o Cost Pressures: Volatility in raw material prices, particularly PVC resin, can adversely affect production costs and profit margins. Regulatory Risks o Compliance Challenges: Changes in environmental regulations and compliance requirements may lead to increased operational costs and necessitate process adjustments.\nEconomic Overview of India (As of March 2025)\nIndia's macroeconomic landscape showed a mixed trend during the first quarter of 2025, shaped by domestic resilience and global uncertainties. Despite global headwinds, the Indian equity markets and broader economic indicators offered encouraging signs of momentum heading into FY26.\nEquity Market Performance\nThe Indian equity markets experienced a moderate rebound by the end of March 2025, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices rising by approximately 6.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Although this recovery was tempered by global volatility, the low base effect from Q1 FY25 earnings is expected to support growth in FY26. However, sustained earnings expansion may hinge more on sales recovery than margin improvements. Future market returns are likely to align closely with actual earnings growth.\nManufacturing and Industrial Activity\nPMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): India's manufacturing PMI rose to an 8-month high of 58.1 in March 2025 (vs 56.3 in February), marking the 44th consecutive month above the 50-point expansion threshold. This rise was driven by strong demand, reflected in a surge in new orders. However, input prices also edged up, reaching a three-month high. Core Sector Production: The index of eight core industries contracted by 2.9% YoY in February 2025, a four-month low, following an upwardly revised growth of 5.1% in January. The contraction was largely due to an unfavorable base effect, though six of the eight sectors, including cement (up 10.5% YoY), recorded positive growth. Industrial Production (IIP): Factory output, measured by the IIP, increased by 5.0% YoY in January 2025 (vs 3.5% in December 2024). The growth was broad-based across manufacturing, mining, and electricity sectors.\nTrade and External Sector\n• Merchandise Trade:\nIn February 2025, exports declined by 10.9% YoY to $36.9 billion, while imports dropped by 16.35% to $50.96 billion. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 28% YoY to $14.05 billion.\n• Macro Dynamics and Global Trade Tensions:\nMarch saw improved domestic macro indicators—falling inflation, stable fiscal and currency conditions, and strong liquidity—even as global markets reacted to rising protectionism. The U.S. doubled tariffs on Chinese goods (20%) and increased steel and aluminum tariffs to 25%, sparking concerns over retaliatory measures and a potential escalation in trade tensions. Markets remained cautious ahead of the anticipated U.S. reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2nd.\nInflation Trends\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3.61% YoY in February 2025, down from 4.26% in January and 5.10% a year ago—below consensus expectations of 4%. This decline was aided by a favorable base effect, lower food prices, and subdued movements in fuel and clothing costs. Food inflation fell to 3.84% YoY, significantly lower than the 9.7% peak in October 2024. However, core inflation edged up slightly to 3.95% YoY (vs 3.67% in January).\nFiscal Position\n\nAnswer concisely and cite facts from the context.",
