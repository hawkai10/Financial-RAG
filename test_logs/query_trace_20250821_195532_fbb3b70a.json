Uncertainty in market demand, especially for large-scale capacity investments. Preference for lower-risk Brownfield expansion in the short term.\nHowever, Greenfield expansion remains inevitable, as:\nNew regional markets (East & South India) require a new facility.\nCurrent plant locations (Ratnagiri, Masar) have limited long-term scalability. Targeting a 1,00,000+ MT capacity addition post-FY27\nFactor Latest Management Commentary \n Capacity 1,00,000+ MT (could go up to 1,50,000 MT) \n Investment ₹400-500 Cr total Capex\nLocation Outside Western India (possibly East India) \n Decision Timeline No announcement before Q3 FY26 \n Construction Lead Time 18-24 months from approval \n Market Rationale Demand growth from plumbing & infra segments\nProjected Timeline Based on Commentary:\nFY26: Site selection & feasibility study. FY27: Final investment decision. FY28-FY29: Construction & phased capacity rollout. FY30: Full commercial production.\nWhy does CWIP grow first?\nGreenfield projects take 18-24 months to build, so assets remain in CWIP before being capitalized into PPE.\nFY30 sees full impact of PPE additions as Greenfield reaches operational status.\nConsolidated PPE Forecast Based on CAGR\nHistorical PPE Growth Rate:\nFY20-FY24 CAGR: ~4.5%-6.0% (mostly brownfield expansion) FY25-FY30 CAGR (Adjusted for Greenfield): Gross PPE: ~8.9% CAGR & Net PPE: ~7.8% CAGR (due to increasing depreciation).\nCapex Plan Integrated:\n₹150 Cr Brownfield Capex (FY25-FY27), ₹250-400 Cr Greenfield Capex (FY28-FY30). Greenfield Capex is phased, leading to rising CWIP before capitalization. Depreciation stabilizes at ~6.5-6.7% of Gross PPE.\nYear Gross PPE YoY Growth \n FY24 2,685 - \n FY25 2,835 5.59% \n FY26 2,985 5.29% \n FY27 3,135 5.03% \n FY28 3,335 6.38% \n FY29 3,585 7.50%\nFY30 3,885 8.37% \n Year (Estimates from FY31 to\nFY34) Gross PPE YoY Growth \n FY31 4,285 10.30% \n FY32 4,685 8.54% \n FY33 5,035 6.95% \n FY34 5,335 5.62%\nRatio Analysis\nCash Conversion Cycle\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is expected to decline from 116.31 Days in FY 2021 to 97.34 Days in FY 2034. This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nWACC Calculation\nThe Cashflow \n Revenues Operating Margin EBIT EBIT(1-t) Reinvestment FCFF \n 1 5308.34 11.15% 983.90 730.43 150.00 624.82 \n 2 5850.69 11.37% 1138.23 846.24 150.00 783.07 \n 3 6463.32 11.39% 1321.18 983.16 150.00 917.48 \n 4 7156.55 11.44% 1527.83 1137.83 200.00 1024.39 \n 5 7942.32 11.49% 1766.09 1316.15 250.00 1156.63 \n 6 8734.56 11.45% 2027.70 1511.85 300.00 1325.58 \n 7 9517.97 11.50% 2295.61 1712.23 400.00 1455.64 \n 8 10275.88 11.55% 2571.22 1918.31 400.00 1694.34 \n 9 10990.69 11.54% 2851.85 2128.07 350.00 1986.57 \n 10 11644.56 11.63% 3102.92 2315.76 300.00 2247.56 \n Terminal Value 2359.943115 \n The Value \n Terminal Value 43051.07 \n PV(Terminal Value) 16151.95 \n PV(CF of 10 Years) 7202.083 \n Less: Debt -393.95 \n Add: Cash 2.15 \n Value of Equity 22962.23 \n Number of Shares 61.83139 \n Value Per share 371.3686 Stock was Trading at = ₹177\nBased on DCF Valuation, Finolex's Intrinsic Value per share is ₹371\n\nAnswer concisely and cite facts from the context.",
