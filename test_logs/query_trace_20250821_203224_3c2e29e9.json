The valuation was based on projected revenue growth, operating margins, reinvestment requirements, and a calculated terminal value beyond the forecast period.\nCash Flow Projections\nThe revenue is projected to grow consistently over a 10-year period, from ₹5,308.34 crore in Year 1 to ₹11,644.56 crore in Year 10. Operating margins are expected to remain stable in the range of 11.4%– 11.8%, indicating a steady level of profitability.\nUsing these projections, the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) were calculated for each year. After adjusting for taxes, the EBIT(1–t) was derived. The reinvestment required to sustain the business's growth was then deducted to estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF). The FCFF values increase from ₹347.10 crore in Year 1 to ₹896.10 crore in Year 10, reflecting both operational efficiency and strategic reinvestment.\nTerminal Value and Present Value Calculations\nTo account for the value beyond the 10-year forecast period, a terminal value of ₹17,164.44 crore was assumed. This terminal value, when discounted to present value terms, is ₹6,439.77 crore. The present value of the 10 years of forecasted cash flows amounts to ₹3,229.82 crore. The total present value of future cash flows (enterprise value) is therefore estimated at ₹9,669.59 crore.\nEquity Value Estimation\nFrom the enterprise value, net debt of ₹393.95 crore was deducted, and ₹2.15 crore in cash was added, resulting in a total equity value of ₹11,616 crore.\nWith a total of 61.83 crore shares outstanding, the intrinsic value per share is calculated to be ₹187.87.\nRelative Valuation\nFor the relative Valuation portion, we screened firms with the following criteria:\nSame industry as Finolex Industries.

With a current EV of ₹9,669.59 Cr and FY24 revenue of ₹4,464.62 Cr, the company trades at an EV/Sales multiple of ~2.17, which is nearly 31% lower than the industry average of 3.15. At first glance, this might suggest undervaluation. But applying deeper logic to this surface-level discount tells a more complicated story.\nAssume revenue grows at a projected CAGR of 9–10% till 2029, and EBIT margins hold around 11%—a reasonable but not spectacular figure. These inputs point to a business that is fundamentally stable but not bursting with growth, disruption, or pricing power.\nWhat Is the Market Really Pricing In?\nIf we attempt to back-solve from Finolex's current market price of ₹177, we find implied valuations inconsistent with its fundamentals. For example, the EV/EBITDA multiple for positive EBITDA firms in the industry is 26.17, while Finolex would barely command that unless its margins balloon or its growth exceeds expectations dramatically. The same logic applies to EV/Sales and Price/Sales.\nEven more startling: the implied price using the industry P/E multiple (34.78) results in a valuation of ₹256.09, nearly 45% above current levels—but only if the company is treated as an industry average performer, which seems optimistic for a commodity-heavy business facing cyclical pressures.\nSo Why the Optimism?\n\n[Source 2: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nThe Assumptions \n Base Year Next Year Year 2-5 Average Year 6-10 After 10 years Link to story \n Revenue 4,464.62 9.00% 9.63% 7% 5% The company expects the per unit price for resin to stabilize around ₹80 following the imposition of the anti-dumping duty ban. Sales volume has been forecasted based on the average of the last five years, assessed on a quarterly basis. Management projects revenue to grow at approximately 10% in the short term, with additional capacity expansion expected to further support this growth. The industry continues to expand rapidly, driven by a still underserved market for organized sellers. However, over time, as competition intensifies and the market reaches saturation, revenue growth is expected to slow to more moderate levels. \n Operating Margin 11.01% 11.75% 11.42% The margin has been improving slightly. In recent years they have been increasing the average pricing point and introducing new products in order to expand into the agriculture sector. However taking into the fact that the company operates in a highly commodatised and competitive market the margin does not increase by a much. \n Tax Rate 25.79% 25.57% 25.57% Marginal Tax rate of the Industry\nFinolex plans on doing brownfeild as well as greenfield investment in order to increase the capacity. The capex will reach its peak around the years 2029-30 and after 2034 as\nRisk-Free Rate\nTo estimate a more accurate risk-free rate, we began with the yield on India's 10-year government bond, currently at 6.75%. From this, we subtracted the default spread of 2.39%, which reflects India's sovereign credit risk. This spread is derived from India's credit ratings—Baa3 by Moody's and BBB- by S&P both linked to government-issued, secured debt.\nIt is important to note, however, that credit ratings can be somewhat lagging indicators. They often do not capture real-time changes in risk, making them useful but imperfect tools.\nWith the risk-free rate established, the next component in estimating the cost of equity is the equity risk premium (ERP)—the additional return investors expect for choosing equities over a risk-free investment.\nCountry Moody's Rating S&P Rating Default spread \n India Baa3 BBB- 2.39%\nDefault Spread of India 2.39% \n 10 Year Treasury Bonds YTM 6.75% \n Risk Free Rate 4.36%\nEquity Risk Premium\nThe equity risk premium (ERP) represents the expected excess return investors demand for investing in equities instead of risk-free securities.\nTraditionally, ERP is computed as (Rm – Rf)—the expected market return minus the risk-free rate. However, this number varies significantly depending on several factors: the time horizon, whether a longterm bond or short-term treasury bill is used as the risk-free rate, and the averaging method (arithmetic vs. geometric).\nArithmetic Average Geometric Average \n Stocks - T. Bills Stocks - T. Bonds Stocks - T. Bills Stocks - T. Bonds \n 1928-2023 8.32% 6.80% 6.50% 5.23% \n Std Error 2.03% 2.14% \n 1974-2023 8.18% 5.95% 6.79% 4.97% \n Std Error 2.45% 2.73% \n 2014-2023 11.70% 11.17% 10.63% 10.44% \n Std Error 4.97% 3.86%\nFor example, in the U.S. market (the world's most established equity market), historical ERP from 1928 to 2023 averages 6.80%, with a standard error of 2.14%. This implies a 68% confidence interval; for 95% confidence, the standard error doubles, highlighting the significant uncertainty in ERP estimates.\nAs the analysis window narrows, the standard error increases, and the reliability of ERP diminishes.\nTo manage this uncertainty, a more practical method—especially for emerging markets like India—is to begin with the ERP of a mature market (like the U.S.) and then add a country risk premium. This adjustment provides a more robust and context-specific estimate.\nTo estimate the country risk premium, we applied the formula:\nCountry Risk Premium = Default Spread × (σEquity / σBond)\nStd Dev of 10Y Bond 0.79% \n Std Dev of Nifty 50 1.04% \n Default spread of India 2.39% \n Risk Premium of India 3.135% \n Mature Market Premium 4.12% \n Equity Risk Premium 7.25%\nWhere the volatility of the equity market is scaled relative to long-term government bonds.\nWith both the risk-free rate and ERP defined, the final component of the cost of equity is beta, which captures the firm's sensitivity to market movements.\nBeta Estimation\nFor Finolex, we employed an industry beta approach rather than using firm-specific betas, which tend to be volatile and unreliable.\nOur method involved:\nCalculating firm-level betas using 2-year and 5-year weekly return data, assigning a two-thirds weight to the 2-year beta and one-third to the 5-year beta to balance recency and long-term perspective.\nIndustry Name Number of firms Beta D/E Ratio Effective Tax rate Unlevered beta \n PVC Resins Chemical (Basic) 145 0.82x 9.53% 19.97% 0.760x \n PVC Pipes & Fittings Building Materials 57 0.84x 5.48% 18.35% 0.802x \n Revenue Peer EV / Sales Weights Weight Beta \n 132.28 2.73 361.12 0.03 0.02 \n 4185.15 3.17 13266.93 0.97 0.78 \n 4317.43 5.90 13628.05 0.8013\nAveraging these across the industry to arrive at a stable estimate.\nWe then unlevered the industry beta using the sector's average debt-to-equity ratio.\nSince Finolex operates across multiple industries, we computed a weighted average unlevered beta, using peer EV/Sales multiples to proportionally represent exposure to each business segment. The final re-\nlevered beta was adjusted using Finolex's actual capital structure and the prevailing marginal tax rate in India.\nUnlevered Beta 0.801x \n Debt to Equity Ratio 0.0711 \n Tax Rate 25.57% \n Leavered Beta 0.844x \n Cost of Equity 10.48%\nThis led us to a cost of equity of 10.48%.\nCost of Debt\nTo accurately estimate Finolex's cost of debt, we incorporated both country-level and company-specific risks.\nThe methodology was as follows:\nWe began with the risk-free rate, then added:\nThe country default spread, previously used in estimating the risk-free rate.\nA company-specific default spread, derived from Finolex's long-term credit rating and its interest coverage ratio.\nThese three elements combined yield a pre-tax cost of debt of 7.27%.\nCost of Debt \n Type of Company Smaller and riskier firms \n Long Term Debt Rating Aa2/AA \n Interest Coverage Ratio 16.91 \n Default Spread\nbased on \n Debt Rating 0.60% \n ICR 0.45% \n Default Spread of Compa 0.53% \n Default Spread of the Co 2.39% \n Risk Free Rate 4.36% \n Cost of Debt 7.28% \n Post Tax Cost of Debt 5.42%\n\n[Source 3: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nBrownfield capacity (50,000 MT) being sufficient till FY27.

Depreciation stabilizes at ~6.5-6.7% of Gross PPE.\nYear Gross PPE YoY Growth \n FY24 2,685 - \n FY25 2,835 5.59% \n FY26 2,985 5.29% \n FY27 3,135 5.03% \n FY28 3,335 6.38% \n FY29 3,585 7.50%\nFY30 3,885 8.37% \n Year (Estimates from FY31 to\nFY34) Gross PPE YoY Growth \n FY31 4,285 10.30% \n FY32 4,685 8.54% \n FY33 5,035 6.95% \n FY34 5,335 5.62%\nRatio Analysis\nCash Conversion Cycle\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is expected to decline from 116.31 Days in FY 2021 to 97.34 Days in FY 2034. This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nWACC Calculation\nThe Cashflow \n Revenues Operating Margin EBIT EBIT(1-t) Reinvestment FCFF \n 1 5308.34 11.15% 983.90 730.43 150.00 624.82 \n 2 5850.69 11.37% 1138.23 846.24 150.00 783.07 \n 3 6463.32 11.39% 1321.18 983.16 150.00 917.48 \n 4 7156.55 11.44% 1527.83 1137.83 200.00 1024.39 \n 5 7942.32 11.49% 1766.09 1316.15 250.00 1156.63 \n 6 8734.56 11.45% 2027.70 1511.85 300.00 1325.58 \n 7 9517.97 11.50% 2295.61 1712.23 400.00 1455.64 \n 8 10275.88 11.55% 2571.22 1918.31 400.00 1694.34 \n 9 10990.69 11.54% 2851.85 2128.07 350.00 1986.57 \n 10 11644.56 11.63% 3102.92 2315.76 300.00 2247.56 \n Terminal Value 2359.943115 \n The Value \n Terminal Value 43051.07 \n PV(Terminal Value) 16151.95 \n PV(CF of 10 Years) 7202.083 \n Less: Debt -393.95 \n Add: Cash 2.15 \n Value of Equity 22962.23 \n Number of Shares 61.83139 \n Value Per share 371.3686 Stock was Trading at = ₹177\nBased on DCF Valuation, Finolex's Intrinsic Value per share is ₹371\n\nAnswer concisely and cite facts from the context.",
