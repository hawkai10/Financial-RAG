If uncertain, say you don't know.\n\nQuestion: What technology stack is your RAG application's frontend built with\n\n\nRELATED QUERIES:\n- What technology stack is your RAG application's frontend built with\n\nContext:\n[Source 1: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nTax Revenues and GST Collections: Gross tax revenues for April–February FY25 grew by ~11% YoY, driven by robust direct tax collections and stable indirect taxes. However, net tax receipts grew modestly due to front-loaded state devolution. Non-tax revenues also saw a boost from record RBI and PSU dividends. March 2025 marked the 37th consecutive month of GST collections exceeding ₹1.4 trillion, with receipts of ₹1.96 trillion (+9.9% YoY). Union Budget & Fiscal Consolidation: The revised fiscal deficit target for FY25 was lowered to 4.8% of GDP (from 4.9% earlier), despite a downward revision in nominal GDP estimates. For FY26, the government targets a fiscal deficit of 4.4%, backed by strong tax collections and expenditure rationalization, while maintaining capital expenditure levels. The medium-term roadmap aims to reduce the central government's debt-to-GDP ratio to ~50% (from the current 57%) over five years. However, reliance on market borrowings remains high at 74%, above the pre-pandemic average of 66–68%.\nFixed Income Market Outlook\nSupportive Macroeconomic Environment: Improving fundamentals—including easing inflation (below 4%), a narrowing fiscal deficit, and better current account balances—create a conducive environment for accommodative monetary policy. RBI Measures and Liquidity: The Reserve Bank of India has taken proactive steps (FX swaps, Open Market Operations, and longer-tenure VRR auctions) to improve liquidity and support yields. These measures are expected to enhance monetary transmission and foster financial stability. Budget and Policy Alignment: A fiscally prudent budget focused on growth through consumption stimulus and a dovish monetary policy stance from the RBI are expected to support bond yields and interest rate stability. Global Risks Remain: Nevertheless, rising global uncertainties—particularly those stemming from the U.S. trade policy—could introduce volatility in capital flows and impact market sentiment. Market Sentiment:\nGiven RBI's aggressive stance on OMOs and supportive domestic conditions, the fixed income market is expected to remain positive, especially on the duration front. However, global cues including U.S. Treasury movements and tariff developments will remain key watchpoints.\nFinancials Forecasting\nRevenue Outlook and Market Dynamics\nThe management of the company projects a revenue growth rate of approximately 10%, which is in line with broader industry forecasts. Additionally, resin prices are expected to stabilize around ₹80 per unit, following the imposition of the anti-dumping duty ban, which is likely to support pricing stability in the near term.\nIn FY24, the company reported a 1.8% year-over-year decline in revenue, primarily driven by lower PVC prices. However, this decline was offset by a volume growth of 11%, indicating healthy underlying demand.\nSales volume projections have been based on the five-year historical average, assessed on a quarterly basis to smooth out seasonal fluctuations.

However, as the sector matures and competitive pressures rise, revenue growth is expected to gradually moderate over the long term.\nMargin Analysis and Profitability Outlook\nThe company's gross margins improved significantly in FY24, rising from 6.5% in FY23 to 13.8%, reflecting better pricing discipline and cost management. Similarly, EBIT per kg increased notably, from ₹5.09 in FY23 to ₹11.90 in FY24, indicating improved operational efficiency.\nHistorically, the company has maintained an average operating margin of 16.3%. However, margins saw a sharp decline in FY23 due to volatility in raw material prices, particularly in PVC.\nLooking ahead, margins are expected to stabilize around 12%, considering the company operates in a highly commoditized and competitive market that limits pricing power. Management has also indicated that margin volatility is likely to remain low, as intense competition and the standardized nature of the product keep fluctuations in check.\nBased on current projections, EBIT is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.87%, supported by volume growth and an improving product mix, particularly from the expansion of the non-agri segment.\nProperty, Plant & Equipment (PPE) - CapEx & Depreciation\nBasis for forecasting PPE – Assumptions:\nSteady Capex (₹100-200 Cr annually) for brownfield expansion. Cyclical PPE growth, with large jumps during capacity expansions. Erratic movements in CWIP, signaling delayed project execution. Gross PPE growth averaged ~5-8% CAGR over the past decade. PPE growth accelerates during expansion phases but remains stable otherwise\nMacro-economic Trends:\nGovernment Spending on Infrastructure Higher demand for PVC pipes (Jal Jeevan Mission, Smart Cities). Housing & Urbanization Growth More demand for plumbing & fittings (boosting plant capacity needs). Monsoon Cycles Affecting Agriculture Demand Finolex's core agri-piping segment faces periodic volatility. PVC Price Volatility Could impact margins, influencing Capex allocations\nMicro-economic Trends (Company specific – based on Con.

FY27: Final investment decision. FY28-FY29: Construction & phased capacity rollout. FY30: Full commercial production.\nWhy does CWIP grow first?\nGreenfield projects take 18-24 months to build, so assets remain in CWIP before being capitalized into PPE.\nFY30 sees full impact of PPE additions as Greenfield reaches operational status.\nConsolidated PPE Forecast Based on CAGR\nHistorical PPE Growth Rate:\nFY20-FY24 CAGR: ~4.5%-6.0% (mostly brownfield expansion) FY25-FY30 CAGR (Adjusted for Greenfield): Gross PPE: ~8.9% CAGR & Net PPE: ~7.8% CAGR (due to increasing depreciation).\nCapex Plan Integrated:\n₹150 Cr Brownfield Capex (FY25-FY27), ₹250-400 Cr Greenfield Capex (FY28-FY30). Greenfield Capex is phased, leading to rising CWIP before capitalization. Depreciation stabilizes at ~6.5-6.7% of Gross PPE.\nYear Gross PPE YoY Growth \n FY24 2,685 - \n FY25 2,835 5.59% \n FY26 2,985 5.29% \n FY27 3,135 5.03% \n FY28 3,335 6.38% \n FY29 3,585 7.50%\nFY30 3,885 8.37% \n Year (Estimates from FY31 to\nFY34) Gross PPE YoY Growth \n FY31 4,285 10.30% \n FY32 4,685 8.54% \n FY33 5,035 6.95% \n FY34 5,335 5.62%\nRatio Analysis\nCash Conversion Cycle\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is expected to decline from 116.31 Days in FY 2021 to 97.34 Days in FY 2034. This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr. Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nWACC Calculation\nThe Cashflow \n Revenues Operating Margin EBIT EBIT(1-t) Reinvestment FCFF \n 1 5308.34 11.15% 983.90 730.43 150.00 624.82 \n 2 5850.69 11.37% 1138.23 846.24 150.00 783.07 \n 3 6463.32 11.39% 1321.18 983.16 150.00 917.48 \n 4 7156.55 11.44% 1527.83 1137.83 200.00 1024.39 \n 5 7942.32 11.49% 1766.09 1316.15 250.00 1156.63 \n 6 8734.56 11.45% 2027.70 1511.85 300.00 1325.58 \n 7 9517.97 11.50% 2295.61 1712.23 400.00 1455.64 \n 8 10275.88 11.55% 2571.22 1918.31 400.00 1694.34 \n 9 10990.69 11.54% 2851.85 2128.07 350.00 1986.57 \n 10 11644.56 11.63% 3102.92 2315.76 300.00 2247.56 \n Terminal Value 2359.943115 \n The Value \n Terminal Value 43051.07 \n PV(Terminal Value) 16151.95 \n PV(CF of 10 Years) 7202.083 \n Less: Debt -393.95 \n Add: Cash 2.15 \n Value of Equity 22962.23 \n Number of Shares 61.83139 \n Value Per share 371.3686 Stock was Trading at = ₹177\nBased on DCF Valuation, Finolex's Intrinsic Value per share is ₹371\n\n[Source 3: Finolex Industries A Case of Multiple Mismatches]\nFINANCIAL MODELING\nSubmitted To: Mr Hardik Pathak Topic: Fundamental Analysis of Finolex Industries Ltd.\nBuddy Group 9 B005 - Anirudh Agarwal B013 - Bhushit Sardana B015 - Harsh Lohia B024 - Nandini Bansal B032 - Rehan Qureshi B050 - Arvind Kedia\nCompany Introduction\nFinolex Industries Limited is a leading producer of Polyvinyl Chloride,pipes & fittings and PVC resin in India. It is the largest and only backward-integrated pipes & fittings company in India.\nThe Finolex Group of companies was founded in 1958 by Pralhad P. Chhabria and Kishan P. Chhabria, who initially started as a copper cable manufacturer and later diversified into PVC insulated electrical cables for the automobile industry.\nThe Company's diverse product range caters to various sectors., including plumbing, sanitation, and agriculture providing solutions for a wide range of customer needs. Company bifurcates these sectors as Agricultural and Non-Agricultural Sector. The company has a stable long term credit rating of AA+.\nSome of its Demand Drivers are as follows:\nDemand drivers for Non-Agricultural Sector:\nConstruction Market Expansion As urbanisation continues, the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions is expected to remain strong, supporting the growth of the PVC pipe & fittings industry. India's infrastructure output experienced a year-on-year growth of 4.3% in November, driven by robust construction activities. Notably, cement production surged by 13%, and steel production increased by 4.8%, underscoring the sector's expansion. This growth trajectory is expected to sustain the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions in the construction industry. Water Management and Conservation India's rising water scarcity has facilitated a shift towards efficient piping solutions to support water conservation and management. India faces significant water challenges, with approximately 40% of water lost during transmission due to aging infrastructure. This inefficiency has led to a heightened demand for advanced piping solutions to enhance water conservation and management efforts.\nDemand drivers for Agricultural Sector:\nIrrigation Systems Farmers are optimising their water use, which is driving the demand for these systems and PVC pipes. Approximately 47% of plastic pipes in India are utilized in the irrigation sector. With only about 50% of India's 142 million hectares of cultivated land currently under irrigation, there is substantial potential for expansion. The government's Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) aims to invest ₹500 billion over five years to enhance irrigation coverage, directly boosting the demand for PVC pipes. Hydroponic Cultivation expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control.The expansion of greenhouse farming and controlled environment agriculture has increased the need for PVC piping, which is essential for irrigation, misting, and temperature control. While specific statistics are limited, the overall growth in the plastic pipes market suggests a rising demand in this segment. Rural Electrification and Infrastructure rural areas are gaining better access to electricity and modern utilities. As a result, agricultural activity tends to increase, which, in turn, boosts the demand for PVC pipes in various applications.The government's expenditure towards water supply and sanitation has grown at an 11% CAGR to ₹416 billion over the past five years, benefiting the PVC and HDPE pipe sectors. Erratic Rainfall demand for agricultural pipes is likely to see a steady growth. The increasing unpredictability of monsoon patterns has led farmers to adopt advanced irrigation systems to\nensure consistent water supply. This shift is contributing to the sustained growth of the PVC pipes market.\nMaintained short-term credit rating -\nCRISIL / India Ratings\nCorporate Governance\nThe Board of Directors provide a strategic oversight to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders.
