This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034.

This behavior supports the hypothesis that companies removed from the index and later screened for financial viability can benefit from mean-rever sion dynamics , especially when market sentiment shifts rapidly or reverses from prior pessimism.\nFor example, the severe underperformance in 2020 (–48.37%) can be attributed to the acute COVID-19 market shock, which disproportionately affected companies with existing volatility or weak investor confidence. However, in the subsequent recovery phase of 2021, the strategy delivered a 121.72% return , significantly outpacing the benchmark's 83.20%—highlighting its ability to capitalize on deep-value rebounds.\n4.2 COMPARISON WITH BENCHMARK\nThe deletions-based strategy was benchmarked against the Nifty 500 , a diversified and representative index of the Indian equity market, capturing both large-cap and mid-cap segments.\nABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE RETURNS\nOver the entire period, the strategy underperformed the benchmark in raw terms,\ngenerating a CAGR of 12.48% against the Nifty 500's 15.22% . This resulted in a raw alpha of – 2.74% , suggesting that on a cumulative basis, investors would have earned more through passive benchmark exposure. This underperformance is particularly pronounced in years with strong broad-based rallies (e.g., 2017 and 2019), where the deletions portfolio lagged due to limited exposure to index leaders and high-growth stocks.\nHowever, a more nuanced analysis reveals that the deletions strategy held its ground in terms of risk-adjusted returns . Despite lower CAGR, it delivered a higher Sharpe ratio (6.72 vs. 6.38), indicating more efficient returns per unit of risk.\nALPHA GENERATION\nTo assess whether the strategy added value beyond what is expected from its systematic market exposure, Jensen's alpha was calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Using a risk-free rate of 4.35% , the strategy yielded a positive Jensen's alpha of 1.6% , suggesting that it outperformed the return predicted by its beta-adjusted exposure to the market.\nThis is significant: even though raw returns lagged the index, the strategy still created positive risk-adjusted alpha , a key objective in smart beta and alternative index strategies. This implies that the return shortfall is more a function of lower systematic risk exposure , rather than poor security selection.\nVOLATILITY AND DRAWDOWN COM- PARISON\nIn line with expectations, the benchmark's higher CAGR was accompanied by higher volatility ( 1.70% vs. 1.21% ) and slightly deeper drawdowns.\nThis further validates the interpretation that the deletions-based strategy, while more conservative, provided a smoother ride and defen sive characteristics , making it potentially attractive for risk-conscious investors or as a diversifier within a broader portfolio.\n4.4 INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS\nThe performance of the deletions-based strategy over the 2015–2025 period presents a\nnuanced picture. While the strategy did not outperform the benchmark on an absolute return basis, it exhibited meaningful strengths in terms of volatility control, risk-adjusted returns, and recovery potential. A deeper interpretation of these results reveals several underlying drivers and limitations.\nUNDERPERFORMANCE IN CAGR: STRUCTURAL AND BEHAVIORAL DRIVERS\nThe strategy's lower CAGR of 12.48% , compared to the Nifty 500's 15.22% , may be attributed to a combination of structural limita tions and behavioral dynamics inherent in its design:\nSurvival of Weak Candidates : While the bottom 20% of companies were excluded annually based on financial quality metrics, the remaining universe still included stocks that had been removed from the index due to prolonged underperformance or fundamental concerns. Some of these may not have recovered materially, especially if exclusion from the index reflected genuine structural decline rather than temporary dislocation. Shallow Post-Deletion Recovery : The strategy relies on a mean-reversion hypothesis — that stocks removed from a major index will rebound once forced selling pressure subsides. However, in several years (e.g., 2017–2019), recovery momentum appeared weak. This could be because the market continued to favor growth-oriented, index-heavy stocks, while recently deleted names struggled with investor confidence and institutional neglect. Passive Pressure and Market Skew : The increasing dominance of passive investing in India may have amplified upward momentum in benchmark names while suppressing capital flows to deletions. As a result, index-excluded stocks might have stayed undervalued longer, delaying or muting the mean-reversion effect the strategy aims to capture.\nCRISIS AND RECOVERY BEHAVIOR\nThe strategy's behavior during crisis and recovery periods offers strong support for the mean-reversion thesis . In 2020 , during the COVID-19 market crash, the strategy fell more sharply than the benchmark ( –48.37% vs. – 27.58% ), due to higher exposure to out-of-index names that faced steep risk-off sentiment.\nHowever, in 2021 , the strategy experienced a powerful rebound of +121.72% , well above the Nifty 500's +83.20% , as previously discounted stocks surged with renewed liquidity and risk appetite. This highlights the strategy's capacity to participate in rapid post-crash recoveries and validates the premise that fundamentally sound deletions can deliver exceptional upside when market sentiment turns.\nOn the other hand, the strategy performed less favorably during steady bull runs (e.g., 2017–2019), as it lacked exposure to index leaders and momentum-driven sectors like financials or IT, which dominated Nifty 50/Nifty 500 returns during those years.\nTURNOVER DYNAMICS\nDue to its annual rebalancing schedule , the strategy maintained a moderate turnover rate , averaging approximately 35% per year . This turnover is consistent with strategies that employ annual reconstitution and full reweighting, particularly when eligibility depends on a rolling five-year index deletion window.\nNotably, the turnover did not appear to compromise performance or create instability. Since the pool of eligible companies often changed only marginally from year to year, and many names remained in the portfolio for multiple years, the strategy avoided excessive churn , keeping implementation realistic for both individual and institutional investors.\nLIQUIDITY AND IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS\nDespite focusing on non-index names, the strategy was designed to include only stocks that met minimum liquidity thresholds. This ensured that every selected constituent was practi cally tradable , mitigating concerns of slippage or adverse price impact. However, in certain years , especially following large deletions or\nmarket downturns, liquidity in some names may have been marginal , particularly in the smallcap space.\nThese limitations are further compounded by the absence of transaction cost modeling in the backtest. While this was intentional for analytical clarity, incorporating realistic slippage and fees in future versions would offer a more grounded assessment of net returns, especially in years of high volatility or low liquidity.\nSECTOR CONCENTRATION AND PORTFOLIO BIAS\nWhile the strategy was sector-agnostic by design , certain years exhibited unintended sector concentration due to index deletion patterns. For example, sectors like infrastructure, industrials, real estate, and commodities—often more cyclical and capital-intensive—were disproportionately represented in deletion pools during post-crisis phases.\n\n[Source 3: Performance Analysis of a Deletions-Based Investment Strategy in the Indian Equity Market]\nThis exposed the portfolio to higher cy clicality and beta than broad market indices. Conversely, stable or defensive sectors (like FMCG or IT) are less likely to experience deletions from major indices and were thus underrepresented, even though they delivered strong returns in some bull-market years.\nThe strategy's performance profile therefore tilted slightly toward contrarian cyclical value , with limited exposure to secular growth or defensiveness—explaining its occasional underperformance during extended rallies.\n5. CONCLUSION\nThis study set out to evaluate the performance and viability of a systematic deletionsbased investment strategy in the Indian equity market, using the Nifty 500 as the base universe. By constructing portfolios composed of stocks removed from the index over a trailing five-year period and applying a structured financial quality screen, the strategy aimed to identify overlooked recovery candidates while avoiding fundamentally weak companies.\nOver the 11-year backtest period from 2015 to 2025, the strategy generated a Com pounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.48% , compared to 15.22% for the Nifty 500. While the strategy underperformed the\nbenchmark in raw returns, it exhibited lower vol atility (1.21% vs. 1.70%) , smaller drawdowns , and a higher Sharpe ratio (6.72 vs. 6.38) . Furthermore, the strategy produced positive Jen sen's alpha (1.60%) , indicating that it delivered value beyond what would be expected based on market exposure alone.\nThese results suggest that a deletionsbased approach, when combined with robust financial screening, can offer meaningful risk-ad justed returns and may serve as a complemen tary satellite strategy within a diversified portfolio. It particularly benefits from periods of market dislocation, where forced selling and investor overreaction can lead to undervaluation of fundamentally sound firms.\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nThe findings of this research carry important implications for ETF product design and factor strategy implementation in emerging markets. A rules-based deletions ETF tailored to the Indian market could provide investors with unique exposure to out-of-index opportunities that are typically overlooked by traditional passive strategies. Given the strategy's defensive profile and favorable Sharpe ratio, such an ETF may appeal to risk-conscious investors seeking exposure to value, mean-reversion, and contrarian themes.\nHowever, implementation in a live fund would require careful attention to liquidity, trading costs, and regulatory compliance. Real-world application would also necessitate enhanced risk controls, including sector neutrality and transaction cost overlays, to ensure that the fund remains efficient and scalable at institutional asset levels.\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study assumes zero transaction costs and perfect liquidity, which may overstate net returns in practice. Second, survivorship bias could be present, as some delisted or permanently halted stocks may have been excluded from the dataset due to lack of accessible financial data. Third, while the scoring framework is robust, it uses equal weighting across metrics, which may not be optimal across all market cycles or industries.\nFuture research could explore the addition of momentum or sector filters , dynamic weightings, or machine learning techniques to enhance score calibration. Incorporating realworld frictions such as slippage, bid-ask spreads, and execution delays would also offer a more grounded view of live implementability. Furthermore, analyzing the strategy's behavior across different sub-indices (e.g., mid-cap or small-cap deletions) may reveal additional pockets of alpha.\nIn conclusion, while the deletions-based strategy did not outperform the benchmark in absolute terms, it demonstrated consistency, lower risk, and strong recovery potential—making it a viable candidate for further development as a smart beta product in India's growing passive investment ecosystem.\nREFERENCES\nPacer Advisors, Inc .
