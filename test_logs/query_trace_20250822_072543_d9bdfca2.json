Conversely, stable or defensive sectors (like FMCG or IT) are less likely to experience deletions from major indices and were thus underrepresented, even though they delivered strong returns in some bull-market years.\nThe strategy's performance profile therefore tilted slightly toward contrarian cyclical value , with limited exposure to secular growth or defensivenessâ€”explaining its occasional underperformance during extended rallies.\n5. CONCLUSION\nThis study set out to evaluate the performance and viability of a systematic deletionsbased investment strategy in the Indian equity market, using the Nifty 500 as the base universe. By constructing portfolios composed of stocks removed from the index over a trailing five-year period and applying a structured financial quality screen, the strategy aimed to identify overlooked recovery candidates while avoiding fundamentally weak companies.\nOver the 11-year backtest period from 2015 to 2025, the strategy generated a Com pounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.48% , compared to 15.22% for the Nifty 500. While the strategy underperformed the\nbenchmark in raw returns, it exhibited lower vol atility (1.21% vs. 1.70%) , smaller drawdowns , and a higher Sharpe ratio (6.72 vs. 6.38) . Furthermore, the strategy produced positive Jen sen's alpha (1.60%) , indicating that it delivered value beyond what would be expected based on market exposure alone.\nThese results suggest that a deletionsbased approach, when combined with robust financial screening, can offer meaningful risk-ad justed returns and may serve as a complemen tary satellite strategy within a diversified portfolio. It particularly benefits from periods of market dislocation, where forced selling and investor overreaction can lead to undervaluation of fundamentally sound firms.\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nThe findings of this research carry important implications for ETF product design and factor strategy implementation in emerging markets. A rules-based deletions ETF tailored to the Indian market could provide investors with unique exposure to out-of-index opportunities that are typically overlooked by traditional passive strategies. Given the strategy's defensive profile and favorable Sharpe ratio, such an ETF may appeal to risk-conscious investors seeking exposure to value, mean-reversion, and contrarian themes.\nHowever, implementation in a live fund would require careful attention to liquidity, trading costs, and regulatory compliance. Real-world application would also necessitate enhanced risk controls, including sector neutrality and transaction cost overlays, to ensure that the fund remains efficient and scalable at institutional asset levels.\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study assumes zero transaction costs and perfect liquidity, which may overstate net returns in practice. Second, survivorship bias could be present, as some delisted or permanently halted stocks may have been excluded from the dataset due to lack of accessible financial data. Third, while the scoring framework is robust, it uses equal weighting across metrics, which may not be optimal across all market cycles or industries.\nFuture research could explore the addition of momentum or sector filters , dynamic weightings, or machine learning techniques to enhance score calibration. Incorporating realworld frictions such as slippage, bid-ask spreads, and execution delays would also offer a more grounded view of live implementability. Furthermore, analyzing the strategy's behavior across different sub-indices (e.g., mid-cap or small-cap deletions) may reveal additional pockets of alpha.\nIn conclusion, while the deletions-based strategy did not outperform the benchmark in absolute terms, it demonstrated consistency, lower risk, and strong recovery potentialâ€”making it a viable candidate for further development as a smart beta product in India's growing passive investment ecosystem.\nREFERENCES\nPacer Advisors, Inc .
