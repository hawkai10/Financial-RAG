This reflects the inherent cyclical nature of a strategy focused on companies previously removed from the index, many of which are in stages of operational turnaround or market revaluation. Despite these large swings, the strategy's Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the entire period was 12.48% , which while lower than the 15.22% CAGR of the Nifty 500 , still represents a solid absolute performance for a strategy centered around out-of-favor names. RISK AND RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN\nA standout characteristic of the deletions strategy is its relatively low volatility , with an annualized standard deviation of 1.21% , compared to 1.70% for the Nifty 500. This suggests that the strategy, although composed of companies removed from the index (often perceived as higher-risk), delivered more stable returns due to the rigorous financial quality screening applied.\nIn terms of risk-adjusted performance , the strategy generated a Sharpe Ratio of 6.72 , compared to 6.38 for the Nifty 500 . The Sharpe ratio was calculated using a risk-free rate of 4.35% , derived by adjusting India's 10-year government bond yield (6.75%) for the country's credit spread (2.39%). This adjustment ensures a more realistic estimate of true risk-free return in the Indian context.\nPerformance analysis of an investment strategy focusing on companies removed from an index, highlighting its lower volatility and strong risk-adjusted returns compared to the Nifty 500."

Conversely, stable or defensive sectors (like FMCG or IT) are less likely to experience deletions from major indices and were thus underrepresented, even though they delivered strong returns in some bull-market years.\nThe strategy's performance profile therefore tilted slightly toward contrarian cyclical value , with limited exposure to secular growth or defensiveness—explaining its occasional underperformance during extended rallies.\n5. CONCLUSION\nThis study set out to evaluate the performance and viability of a systematic deletionsbased investment strategy in the Indian equity market, using the Nifty 500 as the base universe. By constructing portfolios composed of stocks removed from the index over a trailing five-year period and applying a structured financial quality screen, the strategy aimed to identify overlooked recovery candidates while avoiding fundamentally weak companies.\nOver the 11-year backtest period from 2015 to 2025, the strategy generated a Com pounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.48% , compared to 15.22% for the Nifty 500. While the strategy underperformed the\nbenchmark in raw returns, it exhibited lower vol atility (1.21% vs. 1.70%) , smaller drawdowns , and a higher Sharpe ratio (6.72 vs. 6.38) . Furthermore, the strategy produced positive Jen sen's alpha (1.60%) , indicating that it delivered value beyond what would be expected based on market exposure alone.\nThese results suggest that a deletionsbased approach, when combined with robust financial screening, can offer meaningful risk-ad justed returns and may serve as a complemen tary satellite strategy within a diversified portfolio. It particularly benefits from periods of market dislocation, where forced selling and investor overreaction can lead to undervaluation of fundamentally sound firms.\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nThe findings of this research carry important implications for ETF product design and factor strategy implementation in emerging markets. A rules-based deletions ETF tailored to the Indian market could provide investors with unique exposure to out-of-index opportunities that are typically overlooked by traditional passive strategies. Given the strategy's defensive profile and favorable Sharpe ratio, such an ETF may appeal to risk-conscious investors seeking exposure to value, mean-reversion, and contrarian themes.\nHowever, implementation in a live fund would require careful attention to liquidity, trading costs, and regulatory compliance. Real-world application would also necessitate enhanced risk controls, including sector neutrality and transaction cost overlays, to ensure that the fund remains efficient and scalable at institutional asset levels.\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study assumes zero transaction costs and perfect liquidity, which may overstate net returns in practice. Second, survivorship bias could be present, as some delisted or permanently halted stocks may have been excluded from the dataset due to lack of accessible financial data. Third, while the scoring framework is robust, it uses equal weighting across metrics, which may not be optimal across all market cycles or industries.\nFuture research could explore the addition of momentum or sector filters , dynamic weightings, or machine learning techniques to enhance score calibration. Incorporating realworld frictions such as slippage, bid-ask spreads, and execution delays would also offer a more grounded view of live implementability. Furthermore, analyzing the strategy's behavior across different sub-indices (e.g., mid-cap or small-cap deletions) may reveal additional pockets of alpha.\nIn conclusion, while the deletions-based strategy did not outperform the benchmark in absolute terms, it demonstrated consistency, lower risk, and strong recovery potential—making it a viable candidate for further development as a smart beta product in India's growing passive investment ecosystem.\nREFERENCES\nPacer Advisors, Inc .

This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company.\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization.
