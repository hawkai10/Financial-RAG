This can mainly be attributed to declining days of inventory which is expected to decrease from 168.11 days in 2022 to 124.62 days in 2034. Even though the increasing days of receivables are (11.53 to 22.17) and the declining days of payables (63.32 to 50.32) suggest an opposite trend but they are still not able to set off the decline in the inventory days. Overall , it suggests an efficient working capital management at Finolex.\nNet Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is expected to decline from 21.03% FY 2021 to 19.70% Days in FY 2034. Even though the Net Profit shows an increasing trend over the years , it is set off by an increasing revenue which is expected to grow at a higher rate. This decline in the net profit margin be attributed to increasing Operating Expenses Rs. 595Cr. to Rs. 1756 Cr. which eventually decreases the net profit after tax. Other reasons for a declining Net Profit Margin can be increasing depreciation due to high capital expenditure (73.81 to 336.11) , increasing interest expenses (11.91 to 56.89) and increasing taxes (68.99 to 787.16).\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is expected to increase from 3.47 in FY 2021 to 9.17 in FY 2034. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 to Rs. 11644.56 Here , a point to be noted is that the increase in revenue is relative to the increase in fixed assets , which indicates enhanced sales performance or pricing strategies. This significant increase suggests a notable improvement in the company's asset utilization efficiency.\nFixed Assets Turnover Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio has shown fluctuations initially but is expected to become relatively stable in the forthcoming years. It Decreased from 0.1465 in FY 2021 to 0.0694 in FY 2024 and it is expected to decrease further to 0.0697 in FY 2034. It indicates minimal reliance on debt as the ratio consistently remains below 0.2. A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden.
