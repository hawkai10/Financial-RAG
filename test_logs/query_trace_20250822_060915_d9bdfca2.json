The valuation was based on projected revenue growth, operating margins, reinvestment requirements, and a calculated terminal value beyond the forecast period. Cash Flow Projections The revenue is projected to grow consistently over a 10-year period, from ₹5,308.34 crore in Year 1 to ₹11,644.56 crore in Year 10. Operating margins are expected to remain stable in the range of 11.4%– 11.8%, indicating a steady level of profitability.\nUsing these projections, the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) were calculated for each year. After adjusting for taxes, the EBIT(1–t) was derived. The reinvestment required to sustain the business's growth was then deducted to estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF).

A point to be noted here is that the debt component here is majorly short term debt along with some amount of lease liabilities. Hence , we can conclude that finolex has negligible long term debt which is a very positive signal for the company as there will be minimal interest burden. This Ratio also explains the high interest coverage ratio of the company. Return on Capital Employed\nThe ROCE shows significant fluctuations over the years. Initially , it decreases from 22.59% in FY 2021 to 8.89% in FY 2024. In the further years , it is expected to increase to 17.58% . The early volatility could be due to fluctuating EBIT levels and capital investments, while the later consistency suggests improved operational efficiency and capital utilization. This can be attributed to an increase in revenue from Rs.3008.65 Cr. to Rs. 11644.56 Cr.

Given the strategy's defensive profile and favorable Sharpe ratio, such an ETF may appeal to risk-conscious investors seeking exposure to value, mean-reversion, and contrarian themes.\nHowever, implementation in a live fund would require careful attention to liquidity, trading costs, and regulatory compliance. Real-world application would also necessitate enhanced risk controls, including sector neutrality and transaction cost overlays, to ensure that the fund remains efficient and scalable at institutional asset levels.\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study assumes zero transaction costs and perfect liquidity, which may overstate net returns in practice. Second, survivorship bias could be present, as some delisted or permanently halted stocks may have been excluded from the dataset due to lack of accessible financial data. Third, while the scoring framework is robust, it uses equal weighting across metrics, which may not be optimal across all market cycles or industries.\nFuture research could explore the addition of momentum or sector filters , dynamic weightings, or machine learning techniques to enhance score calibration. Incorporating realworld frictions such as slippage, bid-ask spreads, and execution delays would also offer a more grounded view of live implementability. Furthermore, analyzing the strategy's behavior across different sub-indices (e.g., mid-cap or small-cap deletions) may reveal additional pockets of alpha.\nIn conclusion, while the deletions-based strategy did not outperform the benchmark in absolute terms, it demonstrated consistency, lower risk, and strong recovery potential—making it a viable candidate for further development as a smart beta product in India's growing passive investment ecosystem.\nREFERENCES\nPacer Advisors, Inc .

The valuation was based on projected revenue growth, operating margins, reinvestment requirements, and a calculated terminal value beyond the forecast period.\nCash Flow Projections\nThe revenue is projected to grow consistently over a 10-year period, from ₹5,308.34 crore in Year 1 to ₹11,644.56 crore in Year 10. Operating margins are expected to remain stable in the range of 11.4%– 11.8%, indicating a steady level of profitability.\nUsing these projections, the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) were calculated for each year. After adjusting for taxes, the EBIT(1–t) was derived. The reinvestment required to sustain the business's growth was then deducted to estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF). The FCFF values increase from ₹347.10 crore in Year 1 to ₹896.10 crore in Year 10, reflecting both operational efficiency and strategic reinvestment.\nTerminal Value and Present Value Calculations\nTo account for the value beyond the 10-year forecast period, a terminal value of ₹17,164.44 crore was assumed. This terminal value, when discounted to present value terms, is ₹6,439.77 crore. The present value of the 10 years of forecasted cash flows amounts to ₹3,229.82 crore. The total present value of future cash flows (enterprise value) is therefore estimated at ₹9,669.59 crore.\nEquity Value Estimation\nFrom the enterprise value, net debt of ₹393.95 crore was deducted, and ₹2.15 crore in cash was added, resulting in a total equity value of ₹11,616 crore.\nWith a total of 61.83 crore shares outstanding, the intrinsic value per share is calculated to be ₹187.87.\nRelative Valuation\nFor the relative Valuation portion, we screened firms with the following criteria:\nSame industry as Finolex Industries.

With a current EV of ₹9,669.59 Cr and FY24 revenue of ₹4,464.62 Cr, the company trades at an EV/Sales multiple of ~2.17, which is nearly 31% lower than the industry average of 3.15. At first glance, this might suggest undervaluation. But applying deeper logic to this surface-level discount tells a more complicated story.\nAssume revenue grows at a projected CAGR of 9–10% till 2029, and EBIT margins hold around 11%—a reasonable but not spectacular figure. These inputs point to a business that is fundamentally stable but not bursting with growth, disruption, or pricing power.\nWhat Is the Market Really Pricing In?\nIf we attempt to back-solve from Finolex's current market price of ₹177, we find implied valuations inconsistent with its fundamentals. For example, the EV/EBITDA multiple for positive EBITDA firms in the industry is 26.17, while Finolex would barely command that unless its margins balloon or its growth exceeds expectations dramatically. The same logic applies to EV/Sales and Price/Sales.\nEven more startling: the implied price using the industry P/E multiple (34.78) results in a valuation of ₹256.09, nearly 45% above current levels—but only if the company is treated as an industry average performer, which seems optimistic for a commodity-heavy business facing cyclical pressures.\nSo Why the Optimism?\n\nAnswer concisely and cite facts from the context.",
