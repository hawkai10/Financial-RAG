This step was intended to systematically eliminate firms showing the most severe signs of financial deterioration, such as excessive leverage, poor earnings retention, or aggressive equity issuance.\nBy excluding the lowest quintile, the strategy aimed to avoid allocating capital to companies with the highest risk of continued decline or default.\nEQUAL-WEIGHT PORTFOLIO SELECTION\nFrom the remaining pool of screened companies, the top 100 stocks were selected based on their quality score ranking. Each of these stocks was assigned an equal weight, regardless of market capitalization, sector, or historical performance. This choice reflects a belief in diversifying idiosyncratic risk while ensuring that no single position disproportionately drives overall performance.\nThe equal-weighting approach also avoids unintended tilts toward large-cap or high-\nvolatility stocks and ensures that all constituents contribute equally to returns and risk.\nANNUAL REBALANCING IN MARCH\nThe portfolio was rebalanced annually on March 31st . On this date, the full process of deletion screening, quality scoring, and portfolio reconstruction was repeated using the most recent available data. All positions were liquidated and reallocated in accordance with the newly selected basket of equally weighted stocks.\nThis rebalancing frequency was chosen to limit trading costs while allowing sufficient time for mean-reversion effects to materialize and for updated financial data to be reflected in the screening process.\n3.3 SCORING MECHANISM\nThe scoring framework for evaluating the financial health of companies in the deletions pool was designed to convert a diverse set of raw financial metrics into a standardized, comparable form. This was necessary to enable consistent ranking and filtering of firms across multiple dimensions of financial quality.\nNORMALIZATION USING PERCENTILE RANKING\nGiven the varying scales, units, and distributions of the six financial ratios used in the quality screen, raw values were not directly comparable. To address this, percentile ranking was employed as the primary normalization method. Under this approach, each firm was assigned a score from 0 to 100 for each ratio based on its relative position in the annual distribution of the eligible pool.\nPercentile ranking offers several key advantages:\n• Robustness to Outliers : Extreme values do not disproportionately influence the scale, unlike z-scores.\nComparability Across Metrics : All six metrics are transformed onto the same 0– 100 scale, facilitating equal treatment during aggregation. Interpretability : Percentile scores are easy to understand and interpret in terms of relative ranking.\nZ-score normalization was considered as an alternative but was ultimately not used due to its sensitivity to outliers and its assumption of normally distributed data, which did not hold for several financial metrics with skewed distributions.\nCALCULATION OF COMPOSITE QUALITY SCORE\nFor each company, a composite quality score was computed as the simple arithmetic av erage of its six normalized percentile scores. Each financial metric was assigned an equal weight of 16.67% , reflecting the assumption that no single metric should dominate the overall quality assessment.\nThis composite score provided a unified measure of a firm's financial strength, capturing its standing across multiple dimensions including debt management, capital structure, payout discipline, and dilution risk.\nThe equal-weighted scoring methodology also helped maintain transparency and avoided overfitting or data mining, which could occur if subjective or optimized weights were used.\nTHRESHOLD-BASED FILTERING\nAfter calculating the composite scores, a threshold filter was applied: companies falling in the bottom 20% of the score distribution were excluded from portfolio eligibility. This exclusion was applied annually, and only companies in the top 80% by quality score were retained for portfolio inclusion.\nAll remaining stocks that passed this quality screen were included in the final portfolio on an equal-weighted basis, regardless of how many companies met the criteria in a given year. This dynamic sizing allowed the portfolio to adapt to variations in market conditions and the financial health of the deletions pool each year.\n4.1 PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE\nThe deletions-based investment strategy was tested over an 11-year period from 2015 to 2025, during which it was rebalanced annually based on a rules-driven framework. This period includes a diverse mix of market conditions ranging from the post-2013 recovery phase, the 2020 COVID-19 crash, and the post-pandemic bull rally—offering a robust testing ground for the strategy's behavior across economic cycles.\nANNUAL RETURNS AND VOLATILITY\nTable below summarizes the annual performance of the deletions-based strategy and compares it to the Nifty 500 benchmark:\nThe data reveals several key insights. First, the strategy exhibits significant perfor mance dispersion —with annual returns ranging from a high of +121.72% in 2021 to a low of – 48.37% in 2020. This reflects the inherent cyclical nature of a strategy focused on companies previously removed from the index, many of which are in stages of operational turnaround or market revaluation.\nDespite these large swings, the strategy's Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the entire period was 12.48% , which while lower than the 15.22% CAGR of the Nifty 500 ,\nstill represents a solid absolute performance for a strategy centered around out-of-favor names.\nRISK AND RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN\nA standout characteristic of the deletions strategy is its relatively low volatility , with an annualized standard deviation of 1.21% , compared to 1.70% for the Nifty 500. This suggests that the strategy, although composed of companies removed from the index (often perceived as higher-risk), delivered more stable returns due to the rigorous financial quality screening applied.\nIn terms of risk-adjusted performance , the strategy generated a Sharpe Ratio of 6.72 , compared to 6.38 for the Nifty 500 . The Sharpe ratio was calculated using a risk-free rate of 4.35% , derived by adjusting India's 10-year government bond yield (6.75%) for the country's credit spread (2.39%). This adjustment ensures a more realistic estimate of true risk-free return in the Indian context.\nNotably, the maximum drawdown —the worst peak-to-trough decline in NAV—was 11.15% for the deletions strategy versus 11.65% for the benchmark. This indicates that the strategy was less susceptible to deep losses , even though\nits constituents were formerly excluded from a major index. This resilience is likely attributable to the use of percentile-based quality scoring, which systematically filters out financially weak firms.\nBEHAVIORAL PATTERNS AND CYCLI- CAL RESPONSE\n\nAnswer concisely and cite facts from the context.",
