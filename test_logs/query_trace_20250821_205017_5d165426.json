      "text": "the company projects a revenue growth rate of approximately 10%, which is in line with broader industry forecasts. Additionally, resin prices are expected to stabilize around ₹80 per unit, following the imposition of the anti-dumping duty ban, which is likely to support pricing stability in the near term. In FY24, the company reported a 1.8% year-over-year decline in revenue, primarily driven by lower PVC prices. However, this decline was offset by a volume growth of 11%, indicating healthy underlying demand.\nSales volume projections have been based on the five-year historical average, assessed on a quarterly basis to smooth out seasonal fluctuations. A key growth driver is the non-agricultural segment, which currently accounts for 35% of total revenue. This segment is expected to increase its contribution to 50%, supported by planned capacity expansion initiatives.\nThe broader industry remains in a high-growth phase, largely due to an underserved market and increasing penetration by organized players. However, as the sector matures and competitive pressures rise, revenue growth is expected to gradually moderate over the long term.\nMargin Analysis and Profitability Outlook\nThe company's gross margins improved significantly in FY24, rising from 6.5% in FY23 to 13.8%, reflecting better pricing discipline and cost management. Similarly, EBIT per kg increased notably, from ₹5.09 in FY23 to ₹11.90 in FY24, indicating improved operational efficiency.\nCompany revenue growth projected at 10%, in line with industry forecasts, supported by stable resin prices and strong non-agricultural segment growth.  FY24 saw revenue decline but volume growth offset this.  Improved gross margins and EBIT per kg highlight operational efficiency."

It is the largest and only backward-integrated pipes & fittings company in India.\nThe Finolex Group of companies was founded in 1958 by Pralhad P. Chhabria and Kishan P. Chhabria, who initially started as a copper cable manufacturer and later diversified into PVC insulated electrical cables for the automobile industry.\nThe Company's diverse product range caters to various sectors., including plumbing, sanitation, and agriculture providing solutions for a wide range of customer needs. Company bifurcates these sectors as Agricultural and Non-Agricultural Sector. The company has a stable long term credit rating of AA+.\nSome of its Demand Drivers are as follows:\nDemand drivers for Non-Agricultural Sector:\nConstruction Market Expansion As urbanisation continues, the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions is expected to remain strong, supporting the growth of the PVC pipe & fittings industry. India's infrastructure output experienced a year-on-year growth of 4.3% in November, driven by robust construction activities. Notably, cement production surged by 13%, and steel production increased by 4.8%, underscoring the sector's expansion. This growth trajectory is expected to sustain the demand for reliable and durable piping solutions in the construction industry. Water Management and Conservation India's rising water scarcity has facilitated a shift towards efficient piping solutions to support water conservation and management. India faces significant water challenges, with approximately 40% of water lost during transmission due to aging infrastructure.

Erratic Rainfall demand for agricultural pipes is likely to see a steady growth. The increasing unpredictability of monsoon patterns has led farmers to adopt advanced irrigation systems to\nensure consistent water supply. This shift is contributing to the sustained growth of the PVC pipes market.\nMaintained short-term credit rating -\nCRISIL / India Ratings\nCorporate Governance\nThe Board of Directors provide a strategic oversight to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders. The company has a comprehensive Code of Conduct that sets out clear guidelines for ethical behaviour, responsible business practices, transparency and accountability. They regularly evaluate their governance practices against global standards and industry best practices.\nThey also actively engage their workforce in comprehensive training on a code of conduct, data security, and regulatory compliance, fostering a culture of responsibility. There have been Zero cases of data breach, breach of code of conduct, or cases of corruption and anti-competitive practices.\n30% of their directors are Female and 100% of their employees and KMPs are trained on the code of conduct.\nOn an Average the Non-Executive Directors are paid 5 times normal employees and Mr. Prakash P.

Raw materials are imported at their Ratnagiri jetty and moved through pipelines to storage tanks. A captive 43 MW power plant supports operations. PVC resin is manufactured and transported to plants at Ratnagiri, Pune, and Masar for producing pipes and fittings. These are distributed through dealers to key customer segments in construction and agriculture\nFinolex industries has 4 manufacturing facilities.\nTotal Production capacity of PVC Resin 2,72,000 MT/Annum Total Production Capacity of PVC Pipes & Fittings 4,70,000 MT/ Annum Talent Expertise 1,510 employees Rs. 25.64 Crore CSR Spend 900+ dealers and 30,000+ retail touch points\nEconomic Overview\nIndia's economic performance in FY24 has been nothing short of resilient. Despite global headwinds such as inflation, geopolitical tensions, and high global interest rates, the Indian economy grew by a strong 8.2%, up from 7% in the previous year. Key sectors like construction and manufacturing led this momentum with impressive growth of 9.9% each.\nWhile the agriculture sector experienced slower growth at 1.4%, it's poised for a rebound with better monsoon forecasts and increased government focus on rural development. Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank of India estimates a 7.2% GDP growth in FY25, supported by robust domestic demand, capital expenditure of ₹11.1 lakh crore, and rising urban infrastructure development.\nFor Finolex Industries, this macroeconomic backdrop presents significant opportunities. As a leading player in PVC pipes and fittings, Finolex stands to benefit from increased infrastructure activity, government investment in rural water supply, and urban sanitation projects. The revival in agriculture and growing emphasis on sustainable irrigation will further drive demand for Finolex's agricultural piping solutions—making the economic environment highly conducive for continued growth and expansion.\nIndustry Overview\nGlobal Market Snapshot:\nGlobal PVC pipes market valued at $25.84 billion in 2022, projected to reach $42.69 billion by 2031.
