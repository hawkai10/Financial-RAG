Expected Agent: Full-Agent
------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION DETAILS:
  Intent: Standard
  Confidence: 0.5

  Complexity Level: simple

  Corrected Query: Analyze the impact of using the Nifty 500 index for research.

PROCESSING DETAILS:
  Agent Used: Standard-RAG
  Strategy: Standard
  Processing Time: 8.23 seconds
  Success: True

FULL ANSWER (AS DISPLAYED IN UI):
----------------------------------------
<p>Using the Nifty 500 index as the base universe in research allows for the identification of stocks removed from the index over a trailing period.  This approach, combined with a financial quality screen, aims to find undervalued, potentially recovering companies, while avoiding fundamentally weak ones.  The study shows that this deletions-based strategy can generate competitive risk-adjusted returns, although they may not outperform the Nifty 500 index in raw returns. The strategy demonstrates lower volatility and smaller drawdowns than the Nifty 500, and it also achieves a higher Sharpe ratio and positive Jensen's alpha.  The use of the Nifty 500 as a benchmark allows for comparison and evaluation of the strategy's performance within the broader Indian equity market.</p>
