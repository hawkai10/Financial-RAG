1. Search Within a Specific Folder

Amber Search lets you restrict your search results to a single folder. Once you identify the folder, you can choose “Search only in this folder”, which ensures all retrieved results come exclusively from that location.

Why It’s Useful:

Precision: You won’t be overwhelmed by files outside the context you care about.

Efficiency: Faster searching when you know where to look.

Easy to Use: The UI makes narrowing searches straightforward.

Example: If you want only documents from the “Financial Reports 2023” folder, you can isolate results from just that folder without sifting through the rest of your company’s storage.

2. Search Operators

Amber Search supports advanced operators to refine searches with precision. These include:

Quotes " " → Search for an exact phrase.
Example: "financial year 2022" finds only that exact phrase.

Wildcard * → Replace unknown or flexible parts of a word/phrase.
Example: financ* finds finance, financial, financing, etc.

Exclusion -term → Exclude results containing a specific word.
Example: budget -draft finds documents about budget but excludes draft versions.

Multiple Exclusions → Stack minus operators for finer filtering.
Example: offer 100 licences -customerA -customerB excludes both names.

Field-Specific Operators:

type: → Search by file type (e.g., type:pdf)

author: → Restrict results to documents from a specific author

Why It’s Useful:

Increases control over large datasets.

Helps eliminate irrelevant results.

Enables Google-like search power for business repositories.

3. Tips & Tricks Suggestions at the Bottom of Search Results

When your search doesn’t yield the best results, Amber Search displays a section:
“Didn’t find what you were looking for?”

Here, it suggests query improvements—such as correcting spelling mistakes, rephrasing terms, or trying related keywords. Clicking a suggestion automatically reruns the search with those adjustments.

Why It’s Useful:

Guided refinement → Helps users improve their searches without guesswork.

Error recovery → Corrects typos or poor queries quickly.

Saves time → Eliminates manual retyping of improved queries.

Example: If you typed “annual raport 2023”, Amber might suggest “Did you mean: annual report 2023?” Clicking this fixes your search instantly.

4. Reset All Filters

Amber Search includes a “Reset Filters” option that clears all applied filters at once. Instead of manually removing file types, authors, dates, etc., you can reset everything with a single click.

Why It’s Useful:

Speed: Saves you from clearing each filter one by one.

Workflow-friendly: Lets you move quickly from one search task to another.

Clean start: Ensures no leftover filters affect new searches.

Example: If you had narrowed results by PDFs, 2021, and Author = John Doe, you can clear all filters instantly to begin a fresh query.
