FULL ANSWER (AS DISPLAYED IN UI):
----------------------------------------
<p>Using the Nifty 500 index as the research base in this study allowed for the creation of portfolios from stocks removed from the index over a five-year period.  This approach aimed to find undervalued stocks that were experiencing a period of recovery.  The study found that while the deletions-based strategy did not outperform the Nifty 500 in raw returns, it did demonstrate lower volatility, smaller drawdowns, and a higher Sharpe ratio, suggesting that it provided better risk-adjusted returns.  The strategy also generated a positive Jensen's alpha, meaning it outperformed expectations based solely on market exposure.  Importantly, this strategy performed well during market dislocations, where investor reactions can cause temporary undervaluation of sound companies.  The study also concluded that this approach could be valuable in designing ETFs and developing alternative factor strategies, particularly in emerging markets like India.</p>
